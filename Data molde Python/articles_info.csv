Bacteria,"bacteria, public-health","Understanding Cholera: A brief look into its causes, symptoms and prevention",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/understanding-cholera-a-brief-look-into-its-causes-symptoms-and-prevention/,"July 13, 2024","IntroductionCholera is a bacterial infection that is caused by the bacteriumVibro cholerae. This disease is commonly associated with severe diarrhoea and dehydration symptoms, and is typically caused by the ingestion or consumption of contaminated water or food. Even to this day, Cholera is regarded as one of the diseases that poses a major threat to public health, Cholera outbreaks within communities are usually observed following natural disasters, such as floods. This is mainly due to restricted access to a safe drinking water supply as a result of infrastructure damage or destruction.Cholera infections are also more commonly seen in less developed countries, thus making it a main indicator of social and economic inequalities between populations or within communities. Hence, it is of utmost importance for the public to be educated in this area and understand the disease itself. This article focuses on exploring multiple areas of the disease by highlighting its typical causes, commonly experienced symptoms, potential treatments and future prevention measures.Causes of CholeraAs mentioned at the start of this article, the pathogen that is responsible for the symptoms seen in Cholera infections are a species of bacteria known asVibro cholerae. Drinking water can be easily contaminated withVibro cholerae, thus making it unsafe for human consumption. The reasons for contamination of water may vary from one situation to another, however, the improper handling of sewage disposals remains as one of the most common reasons for Cholera outbreaks that is observed in lesser developed countries around the world.The bacteriumVibro choleraecan be spread from one person to another through the faecal oral route. Faecal matter that is passed through a person infected with Cholera disease can go on to contaminate water supplies. Thus failure to properly and adequately treat the water supplies in the distribution system before public consumption can lead to more of the people in a population or community becoming infected with Cholera after they consume the contaminated water.  Other than drinking water,Vibro choleraemay also be spread and passed onto another person through food. This occurs when a person consumes food that has been previously contaminated with theVibro choleraebacteria from an infected person.Symptoms of CholeraThe severity of symptoms may vary from person to person, and usually mainly depends on the strength of an infected person’s immune system. However, symptoms that are typically seen in patients that are infected with Cholera include severe diarrhoea, which is the frequent passage of loose and watery faecal matter, along with dehydration and vomiting.The onset of symptoms are normally rapidly seen after infection with theVibro choleraebacteria. In some people, symptoms may appear as fast as within a few hours following consumption of contaminated food or water. However, it is also possible for symptoms to have a delayed onset in some people, where it only appears after four or five days followingVibro choleraeinfection.Strategies to prevent infectionsand outbreaksCholera is a disease that can be prevented, given appropriate steps are taken by both the individual themselves and also the general community or population living in the area. In order to prevent Cholera infections and outbreaks within the population or community, it is essential to ensure that the water sanitation process in that area is correctly carried out and  maintained. A clean water supply system prior to public distribution is the best way to prevent Cholera outbreaks in the population area.Besides that, prevention measures should also be taken at the individual level. These may include steps to maintain general hygiene habits, such as proper handwashing and having safe food handling processes. Vaccinations are also highly recommended in endemic areas around the world, where Cholera infections and outbreaks are relatively more likely to be seen than other areas.Treatment OptionsThe main method for treatment of Cholera infections include oral rehydration therapy (also known as ORT) and antibiotics. For more severe cases of Cholera infections, supportive care measures should also be taken, and these measures may include the administration of intravenous fluids. The treatment options mentioned above are mainly designed to manage the symptoms of diarrhoea, which is by focusing on the replacement of lost fluids and electrolytes from the body.ConclusionIn conclusion, Cholera infections and outbreaks are largely preventable. It is important to be mindful that these prevention measures do not only depend on personal hygiene practices, but also require global efforts in order to reinforce proper water sanitation processes and also ensure overall improvement of the general public’s awareness on Cholera disease.","cholera, food microbiology, Food safety, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality, fungi, yeast",From HPP Innovation Week – Part 2,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/from-hpp-innovation-week-part-2/,"July 5, 2024","This is the second of a two-part series of overview blog articles written byChloe Lam(chloe.lam@foodmicrobiology.academy), who attended the HPP Innovation Week session from 18-20 June 2024.Food safety controlRegarding risk analysis for ensuring food safety in food production, HPP has a role in controlling biological hazards (i.e. pathogens). By modifying HPP parameters including pressure, holding time, and water temperature, HPP can be integrated into HACCP plans as the critical control point. According to @Mario González, Ph.d. | HPP Applications Manager at Hiperbaric, HPP even has the potential to reduce the allergenicity of certain foods and reduce the concentration of mycotoxin.HPP can be used to facilitate hazard control in food products. It can be used in controlling the pathogenic microbial concentration. In terms of bacterial inactivation, HPP helps meeting the performance criterion of > 3log reduction of bacteria level established by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference. The limitation of spoilage microorganisms can minimize the formation of TMA, which lowers the risk of food poisoning. Besides, the HPP technique can facilitate the elimination of parasites. Mild HPP conditions for around 180 seconds can completely inactivate parasites from raw fish fillets. The use of mild HPP conditions not only can eliminate parasites, but also minimize the impact on quality.HPP is a versatile nonthermal food preservation technique that inactive pathogens while maintaining sensory and nutritional qualities. The implementation of HPP allows for avoiding product recalls and market withdrawals associated with biological hazards.Application in various productsMultiple researches have been conducted on various food products, including craft beer, cold brew coffee, durian, and seafood. All showed an extended reduction of spoilage bacteria levels after HPP. Unlike thermal pasteurization, HPP maintains the stability of products and does not change the quality profile of food.Taking craft beer as an illustrative example, HPP has a growing market in this field, driven by the increasing popularity and demand.  This technology can extend the shelf-life of products without the need for heating or the addition of preservatives. Even though pasteurization can effectively prevent microbial growth, it would also induce unfavorable alterations such as accelerated aging and developing a stale flavor. Notably, a significant reduction of spoilage bacteria (3.1log) is maintained throughout the product’s shelf-life (@Rui Queirós, Ph.d. | HPP Applications Specialist at Hiperbaric).On the flip side, HPP also proves highly advantageous in preserving the quality of craft beer. It can retain the quality of craft beer without altering sensory attributes, color, and alcohol content. Customers are unable to distinguish HPP-treated beer from untreated samples in sensory tests, indicating the process preserves the intended flavor profile. This highlights HPP’s suitability for maintaining the authentic taste and sensory characteristics of products, avoiding the quality degradation that can occur with heat-based treatments.Overall, the versatility of HPP technology is illustrated where it can extend shelf-life and preserve the inherent sensory qualities that consumers demand, without compromising the integrity of the final product.SummaryHigh Pressure Processing (HPP) is an innovative nonthermal food preservation technology that is transforming the food industry. By using high hydrostatic pressure, HPP can inactivate harmful microorganisms and extend the shelf-life of a wide range of food products, from meat and seafood to beverages and dips, while preserving their natural flavors, nutrients, and appearance. Compared to traditional thermal pasteurisation, HPP offers significant advantages, including the ability to create “clean label” foods with minimal additives, improve visual appeal, and facilitate more efficient and higher-yielding extraction of shellfish meat. With a rapidly growing global market, HPP is well-positioned to address consumer demand for minimally processed, safe, and high-quality foods.","food industry, food manufacturing, food microbiology, food preservation, food processing, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease"
Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality",From HPP Innovation week – Part 1,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/from-hpp-innovation-week-part-1/,"June 30, 2024","Hiperbaric îs a global leader in commercial high pressure processing (HPP) technology and innovation.  From June 18 to 20, they ran HPP Innovation Week, an event to promote innovation with this, the longest and most widely established non-thermal food processing technology in commercial use.In attendance and representing Food Microbiology Academy wasChloe Lam.  Chloe is a 3rd-year biomedical science student at Monash University who is currently undertaking a period of industry placement with us.  Over this and the next blog article, is Chloe’s report on her attendance at the event.  Until 19 July 2024, Chloe can be contacted atchloe.lam@foodmicrobiology.academy.High Pressure Processing (HPP) is a nonthermal food preservation technology that uses hydrostatic pressure to inactivate microorganisms to achieve post-packaging preservation. The pre-packaged food product would be loaded into a basket in a vessel with low-pressure water. To instantly create a high pressure, intensifiers pump high-pressure water into the vessel. Food products would be held in the chamber to eliminate pathogens.BenefitsThis process can inactivate microbes from food, facilitating the creation of clean-label foods with minimal additives, while extending shelf-life and enabling access to long-distance markets. Compared to traditional pasteurisation, HPP has minimal effect on the composition, nutrition level, and the flavor of food. The technology is highly versatile, which is applicable across a wide range of food products including ready-to-eat meals, drinks, dips and sauces, baby food, and pet food.One advantage of HPP over traditional pasteurization is its ability to improve the visual appearance of some food. Nonthermal HPP technology can retain or even enhance food appearance. This is well illustrated in avocado products. High pressure can inactivate the enzyme polyphenol oxidase PPO and prevent the browning of avocados. This, in turn, improves the overall appearance of guacamole and other avocado-based products over long-term storage. Beyond avocado, HPP can also positively impact the visual appearance of raw steak. Treated by HPP, raw steak redness is enhanced without affecting the eating qualities of cooked dark-cutting beef steaks. Steaks exhibit bright red color and have a lower level of reactive substance values, resulting in a more desirable visual presentation.Another key benefit of HPP is its application in shucking – the extraction of meat from shellfish. HPP processes shucking at a faster rate and a lower yield loss.In the case of oysters, HPP is highly recommended as a preservation treatment for several reasons. Firstly, HPP ensures food safety by controlling microorganism levels and extending the shelf life in selling conditions. Secondly, the high pressure of HPP loosens the muscle attached to the shell, allowing effortless extraction of crustacean meat without the use of heat, achieving a significant yield increase from 20-50% more than conventional methods and greatly reducing hand labor.  Moreover, as HPP is carried out in a water-filled chamber, it can hydrate and moisturize oysters, leading to a more appealing appearance. A live shellfish would be preferred to preserve the quality and freshness of seafood. Interestingly, subjecting live shellfish to HPP may even lessen animal suffering, as noted by @Daniela Soto Castro. The shucking application of HPP can also be utilised for extracting fruit, such as durian, which is a more common practice in Asian countries. Overall, the advantages of HPP for shucking include improved efficiency, higher yields, reduced labor, and potential animal welfare benefits, making it a highly valuable technology for the shellfish and seafood industries.Global PotentialHPP has a huge potential in the global market. Spain, US, China, and South Korea are major HPP markets. HPP are primarily used for preserving meat, guacamole, juices and ready-to-eat meals in these markets. An increasing trend of HPP systems is reported with a 15.68% growth of the HPP market from 2022 to 2023. The growth matches the current sustainable food trend of having less processed food with a healthier and cleaner label with minimal additives.Besides, HPP automation can increase productivity in the industry. Food preserving would be more effective. HPP has a typical holding time of 3 minutes which can significantly diminish the level of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. Food preservation would be easier with the HPP.","food manufacturing, food microbiology, food processing, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease"
Bacteria,"bacteria, public-health",Coliforms and their role in ensuring the safety of drinking water,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/coliforms-and-their-role-in-ensuring-the-safety-of-drinking-water/,"June 27, 2024","We are so delighted to welcome Ruby Chin to our team.  Ruby is a 2nd-year biomedical science student at Monash University, with a special interest in microbiology and pharmacology.  She is currently undertaking a four-week industry experience placement with us.  Here’s her first blog article…IntroductionThe water that we drink everyday is regularly treated. In fact, the tap water here in Melbourne, Australia is globally recognised as one of the safest drinking water available. It is absolutely essential to appropriately carry out these water treatment procedures to ensure that it is safe for human consumption and maintain public health. Prior to water treatments, indicator tests are usually carried out to assess the quality of water samples and determine the subsequent steps to be taken afterwards.There are multiple key indicators of water quality, and this is where microbiology comes into play. One of the major indicators of water quality include testing for the presence of coliform bacteria. There are a range of coliforms found naturally in the environment, and having a clear understanding of these microorganisms and the role they play in water quality assessment is key to prevent the spread of waterborne pathogens and diseases. This article discusses what coliforms are, why they matter to us, and how their presence in drinking water relates to water safety and quality.What are coliforms?Coliforms are defined as a group of Gram-negative bacteria that has a rod-shaped morphology. Coliforms that are incubated in laboratories at a temperature between 35 to 37 degree Celsius are able to ferment lactose and in return, produce acids and gases that are released into their environment. They are commonly found in human intestines but usually possess no harm or health risks to us.Despite being harmless within the gastrointestinal tract of our bodies, the detection of coliforms in drinking water can be very helpful, since their presence indicates the potential contamination of water. Water contamination or pollution is typically caused by pathogens that are found within faecal matter. Thus, failure to treat faecal-contaminated water before public distribution poses a serious health risk to the community that is dependent on the water supply.As previously mentioned, there are various types of coliforms around us, withEscherichia colibeing the one of the most well-known examples of a coliform bacteria that is commonly found in faecal matter. Hence, its presence in water samples taken from distribution systems serve as a major indicator of recent faecal contamination of the water.BesidesE. coli, there are two other major types of coliforms – total coliform and faecal coliforms. A range of bacterial species makes up the total coliform group, while total coliforms that are mostly found in faecal matter are separately known as faecal coliforms.How coliforms are detectedDetection tests for coliforms are done by obtaining water samples across different points of the water distribution system. These samples are then carefully screened and analysed by experts for the presence of coliforms. The level of coliforms in the water sample directly correlates to the quality of the water. Although different countries normally have varying standards when it comes to determining the safety of the water for human consumption, one of the major guidelines that is generally accepted is that no total coliform colonies should be present in each 100 millilitres of water that is tested.The importance of coliformsAs stated earlier, coliform detection tests are widely used to ensure water quality and safety. Their presence provides us with early identification of water contamination so that necessary interventions and prevention measures can be promptly taken. This effectively decreases the cases of waterborne illnesses and diseases within a community as it allows time for the contaminated drinking water to be properly treated before public distribution and consumption.It should also be noted that besides bacteria, other harmful pathogens, including viruses and protozoa can also be found in faecal matter. Consumption of these water pathogens can result in detrimental health effects too, such as problems with the gut and heart. Timely intervention is therefore crucial to reduce health risks of the public, and failure to do so can significantly impact the community’s general quality of life and economy.ConclusionAs of today, most countries and organisations around the world have established their own regulatory standards in regards to the quality of drinking water. This highlights the crucial role of coliforms and how early detection of them is paramount to ensure safe drinking water for human consumption.Coliforms have served as a great example of how a good understanding of the features and role of specific microbes can immensely help us to build a healthier and safer community by making appropriate interventions and taking proactive measures against them.","foodborne disease, microbiology, water quality"
Bacteria,"bacteria, public-health",Diverse burden of foodborne disease,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/diverse-burden-of-foodborne-disease/,"May 26, 2024","Foodborne diseases, often referred to as foodborne illnesses, are infections or irritations of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract caused by food or beverages containing harmful bacteria, parasites, viruses, or chemicals. Despite advancements in food safety, these diseases continue to pose a significant threat to public health globally. This article delves into the diverse burden of foodborne disease, exploring its multifaceted impact on health, economies, and societies.Understanding foodborne diseasesFoodborne diseases are typically caused by consuming contaminated food or beverages.

However, the industry also faces challenges such as the fluctuating costs of raw materials and the public’s increasing awareness of the health implications associated with sugar consumption. Manufacturers that can navigate these challenges while continuing to innovate are likely to see ongoing success in the Australian market.In addition, beverage industry continuously faces challenges posed by microbial spoilage, which can lead to economic losses and potential risks to consumer health. Among the various microorganisms affecting the industry,Alicyclobacillusholds a unique position, particularly concerning the spoilage of high-acid beverage products. Understanding the taxonomy, behavior, and control measures ofAlicyclobacillusspecies is essential for maintaining the quality and safety of acidic beverages such as fruit juices and soft drinks.Introduction toAlicyclobacillusAlicyclobacillusis a genus of Gram-positive, acidophilic, thermophilic bacteria known for its ability to spoil acidic food products. This genus was first identified in the 1980s when it was isolated from spoiled apple juice. The most notorious feature of these bacteria is their ability to form endospores, which can withstand harsh conditions, including high temperatures that are typically used for pasteurisation.Taxonomy ofAlicyclobacillusTaxonomically,Alicyclobacillusbelongs to the family Alicyclobacillaceae within the phylum Firmicutes. It is closely related to other spore-forming bacteria, which are known for their resilience in various environments. Over the years, researchers have identified several species within this genus, each with unique traits affecting its interaction with food products. The primary species associated with food spoilage include:Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris: The most commonly detected species in juice and beverage spoilage. It is particularly noted for its ability to produce guaiacol, a compound that imparts a medicinal or smoky off-flavor to contaminated products.Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius: Known for its thermophilic properties, this species can thrive at higher temperatures compared to other members of the genus.Alicyclobacillus herbariusandAlicyclobacillus cycloheptanicus: These species are less common but have been associated with spoilage incidents in certain fruit juice products.Growth and survival characteristicsThe growth ofAlicyclobacillusin high-acid products is facilitated by their ability to survive in low pH conditions, typically found in fruit juices and similar beverages. The spore-forming capability of these bacteria allows them to endure pasteurisation, after which the spores can germinate and grow if the storage conditions are favorable. Factors such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability significantly affect their growth rates and spoilage potential.Spoilage mechanisms and impactAlicyclobacillusdoes not typically pose a health risk to consumers; however, the spoilage caused by these bacteria can lead to significant economic impacts due to product recalls and loss of consumer trust. The primary spoilage mechanism is through the production of off-flavors, especially guaiacol, which causes a medicinal or smoky taste. Additionally, some species might produce other off-flavors, impacting the organoleptic properties of the beverage.Detection and control strategiesDetectingAlicyclobacillusis challenging due to the robust nature of the spores and the subtlety of early spoilage signs. Traditional culturing methods are commonly used alongside more advanced techniques such as PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) to identify and quantifyAlicyclobacillusspores in beverage products.Control strategies often focus on preventing contamination and growth rather than eliminating the organism after contamination has occurred. Some of the most effective control measures include:Enhanced Thermal Processing: Developing pasteurisation protocols that can effectively reduce spore viability without compromising the quality of the beverage.pH Adjustment: Lowering the pH of the product to levels that inhibit spore germination and growth.Hygienic Practices: Implementing stringent hygienic measures in processing environments to minimize contamination from raw materials and equipment...Future perspectivesThe ongoing research intoAlicyclobacillusaims to better understand its biology, improve detection methods, and develop more effective control strategies. Innovations in genomic and biotechnological tools may provide new insights into the mechanisms of resistance and spoilage by this genus, leading to more targeted approaches in managing their impact on the food and beverage industry.ConclusionAlicyclobacillusrepresents a significant challenge in the management of food quality in acidic beverages. While not a direct health threat, the economic implications and potential damage to brand reputation make it a critical focus for research and management in the food processing industry. Through improved understanding and technological advancements, the industry can better safeguard against the spoilage caused by this resilient group of bacteria, ensuring the quality and safety of acidic beverage products for consumers.","beverages, diet, Food, food microbiologist, food microbiology, food preservation, food science, food spoilage, health, nutrition, science"

Examples include aflatoxins, produced byAspergillusmolds, which can be found in nuts, grains, and spices.Biopreservation is a technique that uses naturally occurring microorganisms or their products to inhibit the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in food.The microbial composition of food can vary depending on factors such as the source of the food, processing methods, and storage conditions.Some beneficial bacteria, such as those in the genusLactobacillusandBifidobacterium, are commonly used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products.Foodborne illness outbreaks can occur when multiple people experience similar symptoms after consuming contaminated food from a common source.Food safety regulations and guidelines differ among countries and are often based on risk assessments and scientific evidence.The use of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) is being explored as a potential alternative to antibiotics for controlling bacterial pathogens in food.Some microorganisms, such as those in the genusSaccharomyces, are used in bread making and contribute to the fermentation process, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and alcohol.High-pressure processing (HPP) is a non-thermal food preservation technique that uses high pressure to inactivate microorganisms while retaining the nutritional value and quality of food.Microorganisms can form biofilms on food contact surfaces, making them more resistant to cleaning and sanitising agents.The presence of certain microorganisms, such asPseudomonasspp., can accelerate the spoilage of fresh produce.Foodborne illnesses can have significant economic impacts, including medical costs, loss of productivity, and damage to the reputation of food manufacturers.The study of foodborne pathogens and their transmission routes is essential for developing effective control strategies to prevent foodborne illnesses.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, can produce enzymes that enhance the flavor and texture of food products.Food safety training and education are vital for food handlers and consumers to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure proper food handling practices.Microbial testing is commonly used in the food industry to monitor the quality and safety of food products.Ongoing research in food microbiology aims to develop novel methods for microbial control, improve food preservation techniques, and enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and food.","food microbiologist, food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Bacteria,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, fungi, yeast",Fermented vegetables for health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/fermented-vegetables-for-health/,"June 21, 2023","Tsukemonois a traditional Japanese term that refers to a variety of pickled vegetables. It is a popular side dish and condiment in Japanese cuisine, often served alongside meals to provide a balance of flavors and textures. Tsukemono can range from simple salted pickles to more complex, seasoned and fermented varieties.The process of making tsukemono typically involves preserving vegetables in a brine or salt to extract moisture and promote fermentation. This fermentation process can vary in duration, from a few hours to several months, depending on the desired flavor and texture. The brine or salt mixture may also contain additional seasonings like rice bran, vinegar, soy sauce, miso, or spices to impart different flavors.There are numerous types of tsukemono, each with its unique taste and characteristics. Some common examples include:Shibazuke: A popular tsukemono from Kyoto, made with cucumbers, eggplant, ginger, and perilla leaves, fermented in a sweet and sour purple-red brine.Takuan: Yellow pickled daikon radish, often sliced and served as a crunchy and slightly sweet accompaniment to rice or sushi.Umeboshi: Pickled Japanese plums that are salty, tangy, and sour in taste. They are commonly enjoyed as a condiment or added to rice balls (onigiri).Gari: Sweet and tangy pickled ginger often served with sushi to cleanse the palate between bites.Asazuke: Quick-pickled vegetables that are lightly salted and usually left to marinate for a short time, resulting in a crunchy texture and a refreshing flavor.Fukujinzuke: A mixed vegetable pickle typically used as a condiment for Japanese curry. It consists of various vegetables like daikon, lotus root, and cucumber, pickled in a soy-based sauce.Tsukemono can vary in taste, texture, and appearance depending on the region, ingredients, and preparation methods. They add a vibrant and refreshing element to Japanese meals, providing a balance of flavors to complement the main dishes.Escabecheis a traditional dish and cooking technique that has roots in Spanish cuisine but is also prevalent in Latin American, Filipino, and Mediterranean cuisines. The term “escabeche” refers to a method of preserving and flavoring food by marinating it in a vinegar-based sauce or marinade.In its most common form, escabeche typically involves fish or meat that is first cooked, then immersed in a marinade composed of vinegar, oil, onions, garlic, and various herbs and spices. The dish is then left to marinate for a period of time, allowing the flavors to meld together and the protein to absorb the tangy and aromatic characteristics of the marinade.The marinade used in escabeche can vary depending on the regional and cultural influences. Some common ingredients used in the marinade include:Vinegar: The primary acidic component of escabeche, vinegar provides the distinctive tangy flavor and acts as a preservative.Oil: Usually olive oil or vegetable oil, which adds richness and helps balance the acidity of the vinegar.Onions: Thinly sliced onions are often a key component of the marinade, imparting a sweet and savory flavor.Garlic: Crushed or minced garlic cloves are frequently added to enhance the overall flavor profile.Herbs and Spices: Bay leaves, oregano, thyme, peppercorns, and chili peppers are commonly used to season the marinade and add aromatic and spicy notes.The marinated protein, whether fish or meat, is typically served cold or at room temperature. The marinade not only imparts flavor but also acts as a preservative, allowing the dish to be enjoyed over an extended period. It is common to find escabeche served as an appetizer, a side dish, or even as a main course, accompanied by rice, bread, or other side dishes.Escabeche can be versatile, with variations in different regions and cultures. For example, in the Philippines, it is often made with fried fish and served as a popular dish called “escabeche de pescado.”Overall, escabeche offers a unique blend of flavors, combining the acidity of the vinegar, the richness of the oil, and the aromatic herbs and spices. It provides a tangy and savory addition to the culinary landscape.Pickled watermelon rindis a unique and flavorful food product made from the rind or peel of watermelon, which is typically discarded. Instead of being wasted, the rind is preserved and transformed into a tangy and sweet pickled delicacy.The process of making pickled watermelon rind involves removing the green outer skin and any remaining pink flesh from the watermelon rind. The rind is then typically cut into bite-sized pieces or strips, although shapes can vary depending on personal preference and regional traditions.The rind is then soaked in a brine solution containing vinegar, sugar, and various spices and seasonings. The brine helps to impart flavor, preserve the rind, and balance the natural sweetness with acidity. Commonly used spices and seasonings include cinnamon, cloves, ginger, allspice, and sometimes chili peppers for a touch of heat.After soaking in the brine for a period of time, which can range from a few days to several weeks, the watermelon rind absorbs the flavors and undergoes a transformation. The result is a pickled watermelon rind with a firm yet tender texture and a sweet and tangy taste profile. The rind retains some of its natural sweetness while being infused with the flavors of the brine and spices.Pickled watermelon rind is often enjoyed as a snack or side dish. It can be eaten on its own or paired with other foods like cheese or cured meats. In some regions, it is also used as a condiment or relish, adding a unique touch to sandwiches or salads.The pickling process not only enhances the flavor and texture of the watermelon rind but also helps to extend its shelf life, allowing it to be enjoyed for an extended period. It is a delightful example of utilizing a typically discarded part of the watermelon and transforming it into a delicious and versatile culinary treat.","fermentation, food microbiology, food preservation, food science, foods of the world"
Bacteria,bacteria,"Bacteria, carotenoids and eye health",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/bacteria-carotenoids-and-eye-health/,"June 16, 2023","This piece of work was submitted by Weny Tjong, as a 3rd-year student in the School of Applied Sciences at RMIT University in 2008.  It was part of a wider body of work looking at the potential to have bacterial sources of zeaxanthin incorporated into novel functional food products, a different perspective on food microbiology.  This blog article covers an introduction to carotenoids, their importance in eye health and then some microbial sources of zeaxanthin.  The idea is that these species could form the basis of microbiology processes for industrial production of zeaxanthin for incorporation into food.What are carotenoids?Carotenoids are liposoluble tetraterpenes, they are widely distributed pigments occurring in flowering plants, algae, fungi and bacteria, and also in animals as diverse as birds and crustaceans (Schieber & Carle, 2005). They can only be synthesised by plants and bacteria, and thus their presence in animals is due to ingestion via food and subsequent accumulation in certain tissues. In plants, these carotenoids are localized in subcellular organelles (plastids), such as chloroplasts and chromoplasts. There are two main classes of naturally occurring carotenoids: carotenes and xanthophylls (Saljita, Singhal & Kamat, 2008). Carotenes are hydrocarbons that are either linear or cyclised at one or both ends of the molecule, whereas xanthophylls are the oxygenated derivatives of carotenes. Examples of carotenes include β-carotene and α-carotene, and xanthophylls include violaxanthin, antheraxanthin, zeaxanthin, neoxanthin and lutein.Carotenoids have a conjugated double bond system that constitutes the light absorbing chromophore which gives them their bright colour, and presence in the visible absorption spectrum which aids their identification and quantification (Sajilata, Singhal & Kamat, 2008). All-trans isomers strongly absorb visible light in region between 400 and 500 nm, while cis-isomers absorb light in the near UV region (~ 320 nm).Carotenoids in eye healthThe carotenoids lutein and zeaxanthin may be beneficial to macular health as they are the only carotenoids found in the eye (Jones, 2007). This is also supported by Yeum et al., 1996 and Updike & Schwartz, 2003. Their data indicate that the main carotenoids present in both human macula and lenses are lutein and zeaxanthin. Lutein and zeaxanthin are therefore the primary components of the human macula pigment. Lutein and zeaxanthin concentration is found to be approximately 500 times higher than the concentration in other tissues (Mares-Perlman et al., 2002). Zeaxanthin is more prominent in the inner macula whereas lutein is more dominant away from the fovea. This distribution of lutein and zeaxanthin in the retina suggests the possible role of lutein in protecting the rods that are concentrated in the peripheral retina and zeaxanthin in protecting the cones that are concentrated in the central retina. Bone et al. 1998 has proposed that the role of these macular pigments may be two-fold: to improve visual acuity and to protect the retinal tissues against photo-degradation.Microbial sources of zexanthinMicrobial production of zeaxanthin has gained some interest in the nutraceutical industry. As they are amongst the few microbes that synthesize zeaxanthin as their predominant carotenoid, the choice of the microbial source is critical. The determination of which microorganism produces higher yield of zeaxanthin is carried out by performing HPLC analysis with ultraviolet/visible or photodiode array detection on the extracted carotenoids from the microorganisms (Gierhart, 1995).Sphingobacterium multivorumZeaxanthin is essentially the only carotenoid produced bySphingobacterium multivorum. The pigment formed by this species consists of 95% to 99% zeaxanthin, with the zeaxanthin produced being identical to that ofZea mays(Gierhart, 1995). Since β-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin are the precursors in biosynthesis of zeaxanthin, their presence (~ 5% to 10%) is observed during the initial growth phases ofSphingobacterium multivorumThe hydroxylation of these precursors subsequently leads to zeaxanthin.Sphingobacterium multivorumcultures are able to produce up to 190 mg zeaxanthin per litre, with specific cell concentration of 16 mg per gram dried cellular mass (Sajilata, Singhal & Kamat, 2008). These cultures are grown in media containing glucose or sucrose, sulphur-containing amino acids such as methionie, cysteine or cystine, pyridoxine, and bivalent metal ions such as Fe2+,Co2+,Mo2+or Mn2+.Erwinia herbicolaErwinia herbicolais a non photosynthetic bacterium which is yellow in colour due to accumulation of mono- and di- glucosides of zeaxanthin carotenoids (Sajilata, Singhal & Kamat, 2008).NeospongioccoccumNeospongioccoccumis one of FDA approved generally regarded as safe (GRAS) strains which has been added into poultry feed to enhance their yellow pigmentation (Sajilata, Singhal & Kamat, 2008). In addition, it is known that the green algaNeospongiococcum excentricumproduces up to 0.65% xanthophylls on the dry basis.SpirulinaSajilata, Singhal & Kamat, 2008 has reviewed that this blue-green alga has been fed to cultured prawns to enhance their carapace colour. The zeaxanthin produced bySpirulina, is converted into astaxanthin responsible for the colour enhancement. In the case of broiled chicken, accumulation of zeaxanthin within the flesh is provided bySpirulina, which increases the yellowness and redness in it.There are many more other microbial sources of zeaxanthin. Among these areDunaliella salina,Synechocystissp,Microcystis aeruginosa, andPhaffia rhodozyma. The details of these are available in Sajilata, Singhal & Kamat, 2008.ReferencesBone, R. A., Landrum, J.

Bacteria,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, food-safety, fungi, viruses, yeast",The Food Safety Modernization Act: Transforming Food Safety Practices in the USA,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-food-safety-modernization-act-transforming-food-safety-practices-in-the-usa/,"June 7, 2023","Today, 7 June 2023, is World Food Safety Day, a day the World Health Organisation has set aside to focus on failings in food safety and to celebrate achievements in food safety.  This year’s theme is about how food standards in food safety save lives.  There’s no doubt that they do.  When one looks back to the 19th century, even, or maybe especially, in the the great industrialised nations of the modern world, up and coming food manufacturers, either out of ignorance or deliberately, manufactured foods that were certainly not in the public’s best interests.  While we don’t have the level of morbidity and mortality we once did, there’s no doubt that foodborne disease represents a totally unacceptable high amount of illness, death and economic burden in our communities.  What makes it even more difficult to understand is that foodborne illness is largely preventable, through the following of procedures, processes and protocols that have been developed following rigorous basic scientific research.  Thus, food standards at all levels (local, state, federal), play an absolutely critical role in safeguarding the food supply of a nation.In this article, we want to focus on the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), a turning point in food safety in the United States that came into being only 12 years ago.IntroductionFSMA, enacted in 2011, is a landmark legislation that revolutionized food safety practices in the United States. Designed to address the challenges posed by an increasingly complex and global food supply chain, the FSMA introduced a comprehensive framework to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure the safety of the nation’s food supply. This article examines the key provisions of the FSMA, its impact on the food industry, and the strides made in safeguarding public health through enhanced preventive measures and regulatory oversight.Overview of the FSMAThe FSMA shifted the focus of food safety in the USA from reactive measures to a proactive, preventive approach. It empowered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the authority to set stringent standards and regulations across the entire food supply chain, from farm to fork. The act encompasses several key components, including preventative controls, inspections, import safety, response to outbreaks, and enhanced partnerships.Preventive controlsOne of the cornerstones of the FSMA is the establishment of preventive controls to identify and address potential hazards before they can cause harm. This includes the implementation of Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) by food facilities. HARPC mandates a systematic approach to evaluate and prevent biological, chemical, and physical hazards in food production, processing, and distribution. It requires food manufacturers to develop and implement comprehensive food safety plans, conduct regular risk assessments, and institute preventive measures.Inspections and complianceThe FSMA introduced a risk-based inspection strategy to ensure compliance with food safety standards. It provided the FDA with increased authority to conduct inspections, sampling, and testing of food facilities. The act also mandated the establishment of a third-party certification program, enabling accredited auditors to assess and certify compliance with the FSMA requirements. Non-compliant facilities can be subject to corrective actions, penalties, and even product recalls if necessary.Import safetyRecognizing the importance of imported foods in the American market, the FSMA strengthened the FDA’s oversight of imported food products. It mandated the development of a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP), which places responsibility on importers to verify that their foreign suppliers meet U.S. safety standards. The act also granted the FDA authority to refuse entry to imported goods from non-compliant facilities and increased the frequency of inspections for high-risk products.Outbreak response and partnershipsIn the event of a foodborne illness outbreak, the FSMA equipped the FDA with enhanced tools to respond swiftly and effectively. It established a food tracing system to track and trace products throughout the supply chain, enabling rapid identification of the source of contamination. Furthermore, the FSMA emphasized collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies, as well as industry stakeholders, to share information and resources and foster a culture of proactive food safety practices.Impact and challengesThe FSMA has had a profound impact on the food industry, leading to improved food safety practices and reduced foodborne illnesses. By shifting the focus towards prevention, the act has encouraged proactive measures, such as better recordkeeping, increased training, and improved sanitation practices. However, implementing the FSMA’s requirements posed challenges for smaller farms and food facilities due to resource constraints and compliance costs. To address these concerns, the FDA has provided educational resources, technical assistance, and flexibility in certain compliance deadlines.ConclusionThe Food Safety Modernization Act has transformed the landscape of food safety in the USA. By prioritizing prevention, enhancing regulatory oversight, and fostering collaboration, the FSMA has made significant strides in safeguarding public health and strengthening consumer confidence in the nation’s food supply.

Bacteria,"bacteria, fermented-foods",Kimchi and sauerkraut: Ancient power foods for strong health and wellbeing,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/kimchi-and-sauerkraut-ancient-power-foods-for-strong-health-and-wellbeing/,"May 29, 2023","Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish that has been a staple of Korean cuisine for thousands of years. The origins of kimchi can be traced back to ancient Korea, where it was developed as a way to preserve vegetables during the winter months when fresh produce was scarce.Early forms of kimchi were made by fermenting vegetables like radishes and cucumbers with salt and spices. Over time, the recipe for kimchi evolved to include a variety of vegetables, including cabbage, and the use of chili peppers became more widespread.Kimchi has played an important role in Korean culture and cuisine throughout history. It has been a staple food in Korean households for generations and is often served at special occasions and celebrations.During the Korean War in the 1950s, kimchi became an important symbol of Korean identity and cultural heritage. The government even established a Kimchi Research Institute to promote the production and consumption of kimchi.Today, kimchi is enjoyed not only in Korea but also around the world. Its popularity has led to the development of many different varieties, with different ingredients and levels of spiciness. Kimchi is also known for its many health benefits, including being a good source of vitamins, fiber, and beneficial bacteria that promote gut health.Kimchi is a fermented vegetable dish that is widely consumed in Korean cuisine. It is made by combining cabbage, radishes, scallions, and other vegetables with a spicy and savory seasoning paste, then allowing the mixture to ferment over time. Kimchi is not only delicious but also has several potential health benefits:Probiotic properties: Kimchi is a rich source of beneficial bacteria known as probiotics. These bacteria are known to support digestive health, boost immunity, and may even have a positive impact on mental health.Antioxidants: Kimchi is rich in antioxidants, which help protect the body from damage caused by harmful molecules known as free radicals. Antioxidants are associated with several health benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.Low calorie and high fiber: Kimchi is low in calories but high in fiber, which can help promote feelings of fullness and support healthy digestion.May reduce inflammation: Some studies have suggested that kimchi may help reduce inflammation in the body, which is linked to several chronic diseases. This is due in part to the presence of compounds such as capsaicin, which is found in chili peppers and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.May boost brain function: Some studies have suggested that the probiotics found in kimchi may have a positive impact on brain function, including improving memory and reducing anxiety and depression symptoms.It is important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the health benefits of kimchi, and that some store-bought varieties may be high in sodium and preservatives. Homemade kimchi, or varieties that are low in sodium and preservatives, may offer the most health benefits.Sauerkraut is a type of fermented cabbage that has been consumed for centuries in various forms across Europe. The origins of sauerkraut can be traced back to ancient China, where fermented cabbage was used as a staple food and medicinal remedy.The practice of fermenting cabbage eventually spread to Europe, where it became a popular food among Germanic and Eastern European cultures. Sauerkraut was particularly popular in Germany, where it became a staple food during the winter months when fresh vegetables were scarce.In the 18th century, the British Royal Navy began using sauerkraut as a source of Vitamin C to prevent scurvy among sailors on long voyages. This practice helped popularise sauerkraut outside of Europe and spread its consumption to other parts of the world.During World War I and II, sauerkraut became a symbol of German culture, leading to a temporary decline in its popularity in the United States and other countries. However, in recent years, sauerkraut has experienced a resurgence in popularity due to its numerous health benefits and the growing interest in fermented foods.Today, sauerkraut is enjoyed around the world and is commonly used as a condiment, side dish, or ingredient in various dishes. It is a rich source of vitamins C and K, fibre, and beneficial bacteria that promote gut health.Sauerkraut is a fermented food made from cabbage that has a number of potential health benefits. Here are some of the main health benefits associated with consuming sauerkraut:Rich in probiotics: Sauerkraut is a great source of beneficial bacteria, also known as probiotics. These bacteria can help promote gut health, improve digestion, and strengthen the immune system.High in nutrients: Sauerkraut is rich in vitamins C and K, as well as other nutrients like fiber and antioxidants. Vitamin C is an important antioxidant that can help protect the body against damage from free radicals, while vitamin K is important for bone health and blood clotting.May help reduce inflammation: Some research suggests that the probiotics in sauerkraut may help reduce inflammation in the body. Inflammation is linked to a number of chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.May improve digestion: The probiotics in sauerkraut can help improve digestion by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. This can lead to improved digestion and reduced symptoms of digestive issues like bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.May support weight loss: Sauerkraut is low in calories and high in fiber, which can help promote feelings of fullness and reduce overall calorie intake.

(Source: Food Safety News)Food safety is a critical issue that affects the health and well-being of millions of people in the United States. As a result, the federal government has implemented a series of regulations and guidelines to ensure the safety and quality of the food supply. In this essay, we will explore how food safety is regulated in the United States and the measures that are in place to protect consumers.The primary agency responsible for regulating food safety in the United States is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is responsible for ensuring that all food products sold in the United States are safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. The FDA has the authority to inspect food facilities, enforce food safety regulations, and initiate recalls of unsafe food products.One of the most significant regulations implemented by the FDA is the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), which was signed into law in 2011. The FSMA represents the most significant overhaul of the food safety system in the United States in over 70 years. The act focuses on preventing foodborne illnesses rather than just responding to them after they occur. It requires food facilities to have written plans for identifying and preventing potential hazards in their operations, and it gives the FDA the authority to enforce these plans through inspections and other measures.Another key agency responsible for food safety regulation is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA is responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of meat, poultry, and egg products. The agency inspects slaughterhouses and processing facilities, monitors labeling and packaging, and enforces regulations related to animal welfare.The USDA also oversees the labeling of organic foods. Organic foods are produced without the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, genetic engineering, irradiation, or sewage sludge. The USDA has established guidelines for organic certification, and products that meet these guidelines can be labeled as “USDA Organic.”In addition to the FDA and USDA, several other agencies play a role in food safety regulation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the use of pesticides on crops, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks outbreaks of foodborne illnesses and provides guidance on how to prevent them.To ensure that food products are safe and of high quality, the FDA and USDA conduct inspections of food facilities. These inspections are designed to identify potential hazards in food production and to ensure that facilities are complying with food safety regulations. The frequency of inspections varies depending on the type of facility and the level of risk associated with the products it produces.If a food product is found to be unsafe, the FDA or USDA may issue a recall. A recall is a voluntary or mandatory action taken by a manufacturer or distributor to remove a product from the market. The purpose of a recall is to protect consumers from potentially harmful products. The FDA and USDA have the authority to require a recall if a company does not take voluntary action to remove a product from the market.To further ensure food safety, the FDA and USDA work closely with state and local health departments. State and local health departments are responsible for inspecting food service establishments, such as restaurants and grocery stores, and for investigating outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. These departments also work with the FDA and USDA to monitor food imports and to enforce food safety regulations at the local level.In conclusion, food safety is a critical issue that affects the health and well-being of millions of people in the United States. The FDA, USDA, EPA, CDC, and state and local health departments all play a role in regulating food safety in the United States. Through a combination of regulations, inspections, and recalls, these agencies work to ensure that the food supply is safe and of high quality. While no system is perfect, the measures in place have significantly reduced the number of foodborne illnesses in the United States and have helped to protect the health of consumers.","food microbiology, food regulations, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Bacteria,"bacteria, food-safety",Why is Campylobacter jejuni foodborne disease so common?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/why-is-campylobacter-jejuni-foodborne-disease-so-common/,"May 20, 2023","HISTORY AND BACKGROUNDCampylobacter jejuniwas discovered in 1886 by a Belgian veterinarian named Theobald Smith, who identified it in the intestinal tract of a pig. However, the bacterium was not officially named until 1972, when it was isolated from human feacal samples by researchers in England and namedCampylobacter jejuniby Dr. P.A. Skirrow.Throughout the 1970s and 1980s,Campylobacter jejuniwas recognized as a significant cause of gastroenteritis in humans, particularly in developed countries. Advances in laboratory techniques allowed for more accurate diagnosis and surveillance ofCampylobacterinfections, and the bacterium was increasingly identified as a major cause of foodborne illness.In the 1990s, a large outbreak ofCampylobacterinfection occurred in the United States, linked to contaminated raw milk. The outbreak highlighted the importance of proper food handling and pasteurisation in preventing the spread ofCampylobacter.In the early 2000s, the genome ofCampylobacter jejuniwas sequenced, providing important insights into the bacterium’s biology and pathogenicity. Research continues to focus on understanding the mechanisms by whichCampylobactercauses illness and developing new strategies for prevention and treatment of infection.PATHOGENIC SPECIES OF CAMPYLOBACTERampylobacterspecies that cause foodborne disease are found in a variety of locations, including in the intestinal tracts of animals and humans, as well as in the environment. The most common species that cause foodborne illness isCampylobacter jejuni, but other species that can cause illness include:Campylobacter coli: Commonly found in pigs and can cause foodborne illness in humans.Campylobacter lari: Commonly found in seabirds and shellfish and can cause illness in humans.Campylobacter upsaliensis: Commonly found in dogs and cats and can cause illness in humans.Campylobacter fetus: Commonly found in cattle and sheep and can cause illness in humans, particularly in pregnant women.TheseCampylobacterspecies can contaminate food and water sources, and can also be spread through contact with infected animals or fecal matter. Improper handling and cooking of contaminated food can lead to the transmission ofCampylobacterspecies and subsequent illness in humans.WHERE CAN CAMPYLOBACTER BACTERIA BE FOUND?Campylobacter jejuniis commonly found in raw or undercooked poultry, such as chicken and turkey. In fact, contaminated poultry is one of the most common sources ofCampylobacterinfection. The bacterium can also be found in other types of meat, such as beef and pork, as well as in unpasteurized milk and untreated water sources.In addition,Campylobacter jejunican be present on the surfaces of raw meat and poultry, as well as on utensils, cutting boards, and other equipment used in the preparation of contaminated meat. Cross-contamination of other foods during food preparation is a common route of transmission.Other foods that have been implicated inCampylobacterinfections include raw shellfish, particularly oysters, and contaminated produce, such as raw vegetables and fruit that have been fertilized with contaminated manure or irrigated with contaminated water.WHAT FOODS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CAMPYLOBACTER FOODBORNE DISEASE?Campylobacter jejuniis commonly found in raw or undercooked poultry, such as chicken and turkey. In fact, contaminated poultry is one of the most common sources ofCampylobacterinfection. The bacterium can also be found in other types of meat, such as beef and pork, as well as in unpasteurized milk and untreated water sources.In addition,Campylobacter jejunican be present on the surfaces of raw meat and poultry, as well as on utensils, cutting boards, and other equipment used in the preparation of contaminated meat. Cross-contamination of other foods during food preparation is a common route of transmission.Other foods that have been implicated inCampylobacterinfections include raw shellfish, particularly oysters, and contaminated produce, such as raw vegetables and fruit that have been fertilized with contaminated manure or irrigated with contaminated water.It’s important to note that not all animals or food products are contaminated withCampylobacter, and proper food handling, preparation, and cooking can help to reduce the risk of infection. Cooking meat and poultry to a safe internal temperature is particularly important in preventingCampylobacterinfection.JUST WHY ARE CAMPYLOBACTER BACTERIA RESPONSIBLE FOR SO MANY CASES OF FOODBORNE DISEASE?Campylobacter jejuniis one of the most common causes of foodborne illness worldwide. This bacterium is responsible for causing gastroenteritis, which is an infection of the digestive system. There are several reasons whyCampylobacter jejuniis so common in causing foodborne illness:Prevalence in animal populations:Campylobacter jejuniis commonly found in the intestinal tracts of many domestic and wild animals, including chickens, cattle, and pigs. As a result, contaminated animal products such as meat and milk are common sources of infection.Resistance to environmental stress:Campylobacter jejuniis able to survive in a wide range of environmental conditions, including refrigeration and freezing. This allows the bacterium to survive on food surfaces and in water sources.Low infectious dose: The infectious dose ofCampylobacter jejuniis relatively low, which means that a small amount of contaminated food can cause illness.Human susceptibility: Humans are highly susceptible toCampylobacter jejuniinfection, especially young children and the elderly. In addition, people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop severe illness.Cross-contamination:Campylobacter jejunican easily be spread from contaminated food to other surfaces and foods through cross-contamination, such as when preparing food in the same area or with the same utensils as contaminated food.Improper cooking: Cooking meat and poultry to a safe temperature is essential to preventCampylobacter jejuniinfection. However, many people do not cook their food to the recommended temperature, which can allow the bacterium to survive and cause illness.",
Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality",Philip Button’s MSc thesis and PhD thesis,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/philip-buttons-msc-thesis-and-phd-thesis/,"May 14, 2023","Please find below, Dr Philip Button’s two postgraduate research degree theses.  Not sure if this constitutes a blog article or more of a webpage, but it nevertheless documents a full-time research journey in bacterial physiology from June 2000 until August 2007, first at La Trobe University, then at The University of Melbourne.Dr Button commenced his PhD studies in the School of Agriculture and Food Systems at The University of Melbourne on 1 July 2002 and submitted his thesis for examination on 24 August 2007.  He graduated PhD on 5 April 2008 in Wilson Hall, on the University’s Parkville campus.  His topic of investigation was on spoilage of UHT milk due to residual activity from thermostable proteases and lipases originating from raw milk psychotropicPseudomonasspecies, such asP. fluorescens.Dr Button published one peer-reviewed original research paper from his PhD thesis, in theJournal of Food Quality, and a peer-reviewed book chapter.Spoilage of UHT milk is of concern to the Australian dairy industry.  Bacterial lipases and proteases have been identified as a key cause of spoilage of long life dairy products. They are synthesised in raw milk by psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. during refrigerated storage and persist as active enzymes in dairy products owing to retention of activity after heat treatment. The continuing action of lipase and protease may cause spoilage of all long life dairy products, including UHT milk, butter and cheese.The aims of this PhD project were to: I) optimise assays for lipase and protease produced by psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. and identify those which are more sensitive than those currently available, II) correlate the progress of lipolysis and proteolysis in these assays with the accumulation of products of lipolysis and proteolysis in UHT milk during storage, and relate it to common organoleptic defects in UHT milk, and, III) identify sources of psychrotrophic Pseudomonas spp. in raw milk and the industry practices likely to contribute to the presence of lipases and proteases from psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. in UHT milk.The present study identified lipase and protease assays which could be used to detect limited lipolysis and proteolysis in UHT milk that may result in organoleptic defects during shelf life. These assays utilised the milk-like substrate triolein for lipase detection and the labelled substrate FITC-casein for protease detection. In these assays, a strong correlation was observed between the extent of hydrolysis of the substrate in the assay and the progress of lipolysis and proteolysis in milk. Furthermore, these assays could be used to detect levels of lipolysis or proteolysis that are likely to result in spoilage in UHT milk after three to five months of storage.The progress of some biochemical changes in UHT milk have been followed during shelf life. The shelf life of the milk sample was limited by the development of age gelation, which occurred after viscosity increased to 120-150 mPas, although there were no appreciable off-aromas or off-flavours at this time. Age gelation was accompanied by a large decline in the kappa-casein content, particularly in the days immediately prior to its development. At no time were off-aromas or off-flavours reported. This is consistent with the absence of measurable quantities of hydrophobic peptides and free fatty acids which contribute to flavour, in the samples.PsychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. were isolated from farm, tanker and silo milk. A total of 39 PFGE Types were identified among 45 isolates which demonstrated considerable genetic diversity inPseudomonasspp. in raw milk.  Isolates from one of the farms and from the silo had the greatest potential for causing spoilage. This is because proportions of the strongly lipolytic and proteolytic isolates were higher and they grew to spoilage levels more quickly than isolates from other sources. Although incubation of the milk at 10 ºC led to fasterPseudomonasspp. growth, this growth temperature resulted in the proliferation of bacteria that were less lipolytic and proteolytic than did incubation at 4 ºC. After growing at 4 ºC, thePseudomonasspp. were also more lipolytic and proteolytic than the bacteria present in the unincubated milk.Specificity of a typical psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. protease, protease B52 fromPseudomonasfluorescensB52, towards as- and b-casein was investigated. Mass spectral analysis revealed limited specificity, with the peptides released being mostly hydrophilic. This result suggests that B52 protease is unlikely to cause bitterness from degradation of as- and b-casein.The present study has improved our basic understanding of psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. lipase and protease action in UHT milk. In addition, information has been provided to industry regarding improved detection methods along with sources and practices that may contribute to increased lipase and protease contamination of UHT milk and other long-life dairy products.phd-thesis-philip-button-the-university-of-melbourneDownloadFor his MSc, a 100% research degree in the Department of Agricultural Sciences at La Trobe University,  Dr Button undertook some voluntary pre-reading and a review of the literature in May and June of 2000, before enrolling into an MSc in July of that year.  He submitted his thesis in March 2002 and graduated on 28 March 2003.  Characterisation of extracellular high-affinity iron binding proteins secreted by pork spoilage psychotrophicPseudomonasspecies, in particularP. putida, was the topic of his research.Food spoilage results in major economic losses in the domestic and export markets as well as in the home. In addition, the possibility of gastrointestinal concerns arise, if the food contains an extreme number of organisms. Refrigerated, aerobically stored meat is spoiled predominantly by psychrotrophicPseudomonasspecies. These includeP. fragi, P. fluorescens and P. putida.  Previous work in this laboratory identified psychrotrophic pseudomonads as the major spoilage organisms of pork, stored aerobically at chill temperatures.  Furthermore, siderophores were identified in this study as a major component of the ability of these organisms to grow under conditions of iron-deficiency and partial characterisation of a potentially novel siderophore-mediated iron acquisition system was carried out. This present work provided further insights into the biological nature of this system, through the use of bioassays. Bioassays for detection of theE. colisiderophores aerobactin and enterochelin were used as a base on which to develop a new bioasay detection system for this potentially novel pseudomoand siderophore. Responses were investigated to various iron sources as well as supernatants containing siderophore, of varying levels of purification. In order to completely characterise the biological and genetic basis of this system, new mutants were sought by transposon mutagensis which were defective in siderophore biosynthesis. These were to be used for determination of the biosynthetic pathway, characterisation of the genes involved, a new diagnostic bioassay and ultimately, a vaccine. A separate section of work studied a number of hydroxamate producingE. colistrains, of diverse sources. These strains were part of a previous investigation in this laboratory. The aerobactin bioassay, refined during the course of this project, was utilised in screening of these strains. Previously, these strains (of diverse origin) were identified as producers of a hydroxamate of unknown type. All isolates that were hyroxamate positive, were aerobactin positive.msc-thesis-philip-buttonDownload","food microbiologist, food microbiology, food preservation, food science, food spoilage, microbiology"
Bacteria,"bacteria, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Delving into prebiotics and how they benefit our health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/delving-into-prebiotics-and-how-they-benefit-our-health/,"May 8, 2023","Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers or carbohydrates that serve as food for the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. They are typically found in plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Prebiotics cannot be broken down by the human digestive system, so they pass through the stomach and small intestine undigested and reach the colon intact.Once in the colon, prebiotics are fermented by the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. This fermentation process produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are the main source of energy for the cells lining the colon. SCFAs also play an important role in maintaining gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria.Prebiotics are beneficial to our health in many ways. They have been shown to improve digestive health, boost immunity, lower inflammation, and improve metabolic health. They also help to maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut microbiota, which is important for overall health and wellbeing.Examples of prebiotics include inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS), and resistant starch. These compounds are found in foods like bananas, onions, garlic, asparagus, oats, and legumes. To maximize the prebiotic content of your diet, it’s important to consume a variety of fiber-rich plant-based foods.Inulin is a type of prebiotic dietary fiber that is found in a variety of plant-based foods. It is a complex carbohydrate that is made up of chains of fructose molecules, and it is resistant to digestion in the human small intestine. Inulin is fermented by the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that provide energy to the cells lining the colon and promote gut health.Inulin is commonly extracted from plants like chicory root, Jerusalem artichoke, and agave. It is used as an ingredient in a variety of food products, including yogurts, bars, cereals, and baked goods, as well as dietary supplements. Inulin is often added to foods to increase their fiber content and improve their nutritional profile.Research has shown that consuming inulin may have several health benefits, including improving digestive health, boosting immunity, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, inulin has been found to increase feelings of fullness and aid in weight management, making it a popular ingredient in weight loss products.Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are both types of prebiotic dietary fibers that serve as food for the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. However, there are some differences between the two.FOS are made up of chains of fructose molecules, while GOS are made up of chains of galactose molecules. Both FOS and GOS are resistant to digestion in the small intestine, and they are fermented by the beneficial bacteria in the colon, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that provide energy to the cells lining the colon and promote gut health.FOS are commonly found in foods like chicory root, onions, garlic, and asparagus. They have a slightly sweet taste and are often used as a natural sweetener in food products. FOS have been shown to improve digestive health, boost immunity, and lower inflammation.GOS are less commonly found in food, but they can be synthesized from lactose, which is found in milk. GOS are often added to infant formula to mimic the prebiotic effects of human milk. GOS have been shown to improve gut health and reduce the risk of infections in infants.Overall, FOS and GOS are similar in their prebiotic effects and health benefits, but they have different chemical structures and sources. Both can be beneficial to consume as part of a healthy diet.Prebiotic resistant starch is a type of dietary fiber that is resistant to digestion in the small intestine and serves as food for the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. Resistant starch is a form of starch that is not broken down by digestive enzymes in the small intestine and instead reaches the colon intact, where it is fermented by the gut microbiota.Resistant starch is found in foods like legumes, whole grains, green bananas, and potatoes that have been cooked and then cooled. When these foods are cooked and cooled, the starch molecules undergo a process called retrogradation, which increases their resistance to digestion.Research has shown that consuming prebiotic resistant starch may have several health benefits, including improving digestive health, reducing inflammation, and lowering the risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. Prebiotic resistant starch has also been found to improve insulin sensitivity and aid in weight management by increasing feelings of fullness.It’s important to note that not all types of starch are prebiotic resistant starch. For example, highly processed foods like white bread and white rice have very little resistant starch, while whole grain bread and brown rice have higher amounts. To increase your intake of prebiotic resistant starch, it’s recommended to consume a variety of whole foods that are rich in resistant starch.","food microbiology, food science, gut health, gut microbiome, gut microflora, microbiology"
Bacteria,bacteria,Where microorganisms can be found…,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/where-microorganisms-can-be-found/,"April 27, 2023","Really, the question to ask is where microorganisms CANNOT be found.  This is because microorganisms are ubiquitous on Earth and can be found thriving in a wide range of extreme environments that are hostile to most other forms of life. These extremophilic microorganisms have developed unique adaptations to survive and even thrive in conditions that are considered extreme by human standards. From scorching deserts to freezing polar regions, from acidic lakes to high-pressure ocean depths, microorganisms have colonized diverse and inhospitable habitats, showcasing their remarkable resilience and versatility. In this article, we will explore some of the extreme environments where microorganisms can be found on Earth.…but first, how is this relevant to food microbiology you might be wondering?  Well, food and especially processing parameters present some pretty inhospitable conditions for bacteria.  For one, understanding physiological adaptation mechanisms of bacteria provides insightful clues as to how these same species survive and/or thrive in food and in the manufacturing environment and result in food spoilage or foodborne  disease.  Then, microorganisms from extreme environments could very well hold the key to solving many global challenges, not only in food microbiology, but in other areas too.  So let’s take a look, just where can microorganisms be found…Hot springs and geothermal areas: Hot springs and geothermal areas are prime examples of extreme environments where microorganisms thrive. These areas are characterised by high temperatures, often above the boiling point of water, and extreme acidity or alkalinity. Microbes such as thermophiles, which are heat-loving microorganisms, are well adapted to these conditions. They can be found in hot springs, geysers, and volcanic vents, where they can withstand temperatures up to 122 °C (252 °F) and survive in highly acidic or alkaline environments. Some thermophiles, such as the famous bacteriumThermus aquaticus, have even been used in biotechnological applications, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique, due to their ability to withstand high temperatures.Polar regions: The Arctic and Antarctic regions are known for their harsh, cold environments, with freezing temperatures, extreme winds, and prolonged periods of darkness. Yet, even in these conditions, microorganisms can be found thriving. Psychrophiles, or cold-loving microorganisms, have adapted to survive in these extreme cold environments. They are capable of functioning at sub-zero temperatures and can be found in ice, snow, and permafrost. These microorganisms play critical roles in nutrient cycling and ecosystem functioning in polar regions, and their ability to survive in extreme cold has important implications for astrobiology and the search for life on other icy bodies in the solar system.Deep sea and hydrothermal vents: The deep sea is another extreme environment where microorganisms have adapted to survive under high pressure, total darkness, and low nutrient availability. Deep-sea microorganisms, known as barophiles or piezophiles, can withstand pressures up to 1 000 times that of sea level and are found in the deepest trenches of the ocean. Hydrothermal vents, located along mid-ocean ridges, are particularly extreme environments where high-pressure, high-temperature, and chemically-rich conditions exist. These vents are home to diverse microbial communities that rely on chemosynthesis, a process where microbes use chemicals rather than sunlight to produce energy. These microbes, known as thermophilic or hyperthermophilic chemosynthetic bacteria, have evolved to survive in the extreme conditions of hydrothermal vents and play a crucial role in supporting complex ecosystems in these dark and inhospitable environments.Acidic and alkaline environments: Microorganisms have also adapted to thrive in extremely acidic or alkaline environments, where the pH is far outside the range of neutral conditions. For example, acidophiles are microorganisms that are capable of surviving in highly acidic environments, such as acid mine drainage sites, volcanic craters, and acidic lakes. These microorganisms have unique enzymes and membrane proteins that allow them to survive and reproduce in such hostile conditions. Similarly, alkaliphiles are microorganisms that thrive in highly alkaline environments, such as soda lakes, saline soils, and alkaline soils. They have adapted to tolerate high pH levels and often have specialized metabolic pathways to cope with the extreme alkaline conditions.Extreme dryness: Microorganisms have also been found in some of the driest places on Earth, deserts are known for their extreme aridity, with very limited water availability and high temperatures during the day, and extreme cold temperatures at night. Despite these harsh conditions, microorganisms have been found in desert environments, including hot deserts such as the Sahara in Africa and the Atacama Desert in South America, as well as cold deserts such as the Antarctic Desert. Microbes in deserts are well adapted to survive in environments with limited water, high salinity, and high UV radiation. Some microorganisms, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of surviving in a dormant state for extended periods of time, known as cryptobiosis, and can revive and start growing once favorable conditions return. Additionally, microorganisms in deserts play a crucial role in nutrient cycling, as they are responsible for fixing nitrogen and releasing it into the soil, which supports the growth of plants and other life forms in these extreme environments.High-altitude Mountains: High-altitude mountains, such as the Himalayas and the Andes, are known for their extreme cold, low oxygen levels, and high UV radiation. Despite these challenging conditions, microorganisms have been found thriving in these environments, even at altitudes above 6 000 metres where human survival is extremely difficult. Microbes in high-altitude mountains are often found in snow, ice, and rocks, and are capable of surviving in low-oxygen conditions by undergoing metabolic adaptations, such as increasing their production of antioxidant enzymes to counteract the damaging effects of high UV radiation. These microorganisms play a crucial role in weathering of rocks and nutrient cycling, and their ability to survive in these extreme environments has","biology, ecology, microbiology"
Bacteria,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",The gut-brain connection: How gut health impacts anxiety and mental health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-gut-brain-connection-how-gut-health-impacts-anxiety-and-mental-health/,"April 16, 2023","Introduction to the gut-brain connectionThe human body is an incredibly complex system, and it’s only in recent years that we’ve begun to understand the intricate connections between our organs and systems. One of the most fascinating of these is the gut-brain connection, which refers to the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. This connection is the reason why gut health is crucial for mental health and why an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to anxiety and depression.What is gut health and why is it important for mental health?Gut health refers to the balance of microorganisms in the gut, which includes bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These microorganisms play a crucial role in the body’s immune system, digestion, and overall health. When the balance of microorganisms in the gut is disrupted, it can lead to a range of health problems, including mental health issues.Research has shown that the gut is often referred to as the second brain, and it’s easy to see why. The gut contains over 100 million neurons, which communicate with the brain via the vagus nerve. This communication plays a vital role in regulating mood, behavior, and cognitive function.The gut microbiome and its impact on mental healthThe gut microbiome refers to the collection of microorganisms that live in the gut. This microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health, and research has shown that it also has a significant impact on mental health. The gut microbiome communicates with the brain via the gut-brain axis, which means that an imbalance in the microbiome can have a direct impact on mental health.Studies have shown that people with depression and anxiety often have an imbalance in their gut microbiome. This imbalance can lead to inflammation, which is a known contributor to mental health issues. Additionally, an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to nutrient deficiencies, which can further contribute to mental health problems.The link between gut health and anxietyAnxiety is a common mental health disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. While the causes of anxiety are complex and varied, research has shown that gut health plays a significant role in its development. Studies have found that people with anxiety often have an imbalance in their gut microbiome, which can lead to an increase in inflammation and a decrease in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin.Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood and behavior, and an imbalance in its production can lead to anxiety and depression. Additionally, the gut microbiome is responsible for the production of GABA, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in reducing anxiety.The link between gut health and depressionDepression is another common mental health disorder that is often linked to gut health. Like anxiety, depression is a complex condition with numerous contributing factors. However, research has shown that an imbalance in the gut microbiome can play a significant role in its development.Studies have found that people with depression often have a lower diversity of gut bacteria, which can lead to inflammation and a decrease in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. Additionally, an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to an increase in the production of stress hormones such as cortisol, which can further contribute to depression.The role of diet in gut health and mental healthDiet plays a vital role in maintaining gut health and can have a significant impact on mental health. A diet that is high in processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats can lead to an imbalance in the gut microbiome and an increase in inflammation. On the other hand, a diet that is rich in whole foods, fiber, and healthy fats can help to promote a healthy gut microbiome and reduce inflammation.Gut-friendly foods to improve mental healthThe following foods are excellent for promoting gut health and improving mental health:Fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, and kimchi, which are rich in probioticsPrebiotic foods such as garlic, onions, and asparagus, which help to feed the good bacteria in the gutFiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which help to promote a healthy gut microbiomeOmega-3 rich foods such as fatty fish, nuts, and seeds, which can help to reduce inflammation and promote healthy brain functionProbiotics and their impact on mental healthProbiotics are live microorganisms that can help to promote a healthy gut microbiome. Studies have shown that taking probiotics can help to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Additionally, probiotics can help to reduce inflammation, which is a known contributor to mental health issues.Lifestyle changes to improve gut health and mental healthIn addition to diet and probiotics, there are several lifestyle changes that people can make to promote gut health and improve mental health. These include:Reducing stress through practices such as meditation, yoga, and deep breathingGetting regular exercise, which can help to reduce inflammation and promote a healthy gut microbiomeGetting enough sleep, which is crucial for both gut health and mental healthAvoiding antibiotics unless absolutely necessary, as they can disrupt the gut microbiomeAvoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, which can disrupt gut healthConclusion: Taking care of your gut for better mental healthIn conclusion, the gut-brain connection is a fascinating and complex system that plays a crucial role in mental health. Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle changes can help to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression and promote better overall mental health. By taking care of your gut, you can take care of your mind.  If you’re struggling with anxiety or depression, take a look at your gut health. Making changes to your diet and lifestyle can have a significant impact on your mental health. Additionally, consider taking a probiotic supplement to help promote a healthy gut microbiome. Remember, taking care of your gut is crucial for taking care of your mind.","anxiety, depression, food microbiology, gut health, gut microbiome, gut microflora, gut-brain axis, mental health, probiotics"
Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality, yeast",Spoilage of high acid fruit-based beverages,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/spoilage-of-high-acid-fruit-based-beverages/,"April 10, 2023","Introduction to food spoilage bacteria and their role in food deteriorationFood spoilage bacteria are microorganisms that cause undesirable changes in food, resulting in a decline in quality, texture, flavor, and color. These bacteria are ubiquitous, meaning they are present everywhere in the environment. They can enter the food chain through raw materials, processing, handling, and storage. When food spoilage bacteria grow and multiply in food, they produce various enzymes, acids, and other metabolites that lead to spoilage.Understanding the different types of food spoilage bacteriaThere are many types of food spoilage bacteria, but the ones that are most commonly associated with juice spoilage are thermophilic, thermoduric, and spore-forming bacteria.Thermophilic bacteria thrive in high-temperature environments and can survive pasteurisation. They cause spoilage in heat-processed beverages such as juice by producing heat-resistant enzymes that break down the carbohydrates and proteins present in the juice.Thermoduric bacteria can survive pasteurisation but do not grow at high temperatures. They can enter the processing plant through raw materials, equipment, and personnel. They cause spoilage by producing off-flavors and odors in the juice.Spore-forming bacteria are heat-resistant and can survive high-temperature processing.

Bacteria,"bacteria, yeast",From microbes to meals: Understanding the benefits and challenges of single cell protein for a sustainable future,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/from-microbes-to-meals-understanding-the-benefits-and-challenges-of-single-cell-protein-for-a-sustainable-future/,"April 5, 2023","Single cell protein (SCP) is a term used to describe protein derived from single-celled organisms. SCP is a valuable source of protein for humans and animals alike, and it has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to traditional protein sources like meat and soy. This article will explore the meaning of SCP, the types of SCP, and the benefits and challenges of SCP in the context of a sustainable future.SCP definition and meaningSCP is protein that is derived from single-celled microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and algae. These microorganisms are grown in controlled environments and their protein is harvested for use as food or feed. SCP has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to traditional protein sources like meat and soy because it is produced using fewer resources and has a smaller environmental impact.Types of SCP and their benefitsThere are several types of SCP, each with its own unique benefits.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality",CRISPR: The next revolution in food microbiology?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/crispr-the-next-revolution-in-food-microbiology/,"March 30, 2023","CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, which is a revolutionary genetic technology that allows scientists to make precise edits to DNA. It is based on a naturally occurring defense mechanism found in certain bacteria that allows them to recognize and destroy invading viruses by cutting their DNA.The CRISPR-Cas system works by using an RNA molecule to guide an enzyme called Cas9 to a specific location in the DNA, where it cuts the DNA strands. This cut can then be used to either delete, replace, or insert new genetic material at the desired location. This technology has the potential to transform a wide range of fields, including medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.CRISPR has already been used to treat genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis in preclinical studies, and has the potential to revolutionize the field of gene therapy. In agriculture, CRISPR can be used to create crops that are more resistant to pests and diseases, and that have improved nutritional content. The technology also has potential applications in environmental conservation and biofuel production.Despite its potential benefits, the use of CRISPR also raises ethical and safety concerns, such as the possibility of unintended genetic changes or the creation of new and potentially harmful organisms. However, with careful regulation and responsible use, CRISPR has the potential to transform the way we approach some of the most pressing challenges facing society today.The history of CRISPR technology is a story of scientific discovery that spans several decades and involves the contributions of many researchers. Here are some of the key milestones in the development of CRISPR technology:1987: The discovery of CRISPR: In 1987, a group of researchers studying the genome of the bacterium E. coli noticed a series of repeating DNA sequences separated by unique “spacer” sequences. These sequences were later named clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or CRISPR.1993: The first CRISPR-associated gene is identified: In 1993, researchers identified the first CRISPR-associated gene, cas1, which was found to be conserved across many different bacteria.2005: The role of CRISPR in bacterial immunity is discovered: In 2005, researchers showed that CRISPR plays a crucial role in bacterial immunity by protecting against viral infections. They found that bacteria incorporate short pieces of viral DNA into their CRISPR arrays, which allows them to recognize and destroy the viral DNA if it enters the cell again.2011: CRISPR is repurposed for genome editing: In 2011, researchers showed that the CRISPR system could be repurposed for genome editing by using a modified version of the Cas9 protein to cut DNA at specific sites in the genome. This allowed for precise and targeted editing of genes in a variety of organisms, including human cells.2012: CRISPR-Cas9 is demonstrated in human cells: In 2012, a team of researchers showed that the CRISPR-Cas9 system could be used to edit the genome of human cells. This breakthrough opened up new possibilities for using CRISPR in biomedical research and gene therapy.2013: CRISPR is used to correct genetic mutations: In 2013, researchers used CRISPR to correct a genetic mutation in human cells that causes a rare genetic disorder called Fanconi anemia. This marked the first time that CRISPR had been used to correct a genetic mutation in human cells.2015: CRISPR-Cas9 is used in agriculture: In 2015, researchers used CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the genome of crops, including tomatoes and wheat, to improve their yield and resistance to pests and disease.Since these breakthroughs, CRISPR technology has rapidly advanced, with new applications and improvements being developed every year. It is now widely recognized as one of the most promising and powerful tools in modern biotechnology.CRISPR is a new genetic technology that differs from traditional genetic engineering in several key ways.Firstly, traditional genetic engineering relies on a process called transgenesis, which involves inserting foreign genetic material into an organism’s DNA. This foreign genetic material is typically derived from a different species, and the insertion is often random and imprecise. In contrast, CRISPR allows for precise editing of an organism’s own DNA, without the need for foreign genetic material.Secondly, traditional genetic engineering often relies on trial and error, with scientists selecting the most desirable traits after many rounds of experimentation. CRISPR, on the other hand, allows for targeted and precise editing of specific genes, allowing scientists to achieve the desired trait with greater accuracy and efficiency.Thirdly, traditional genetic engineering often involves the use of viral vectors or other potentially harmful methods to deliver the foreign genetic material into an organism’s DNA. CRISPR, on the other hand, uses a naturally occurring bacterial defence mechanism that is much safer and more precise.Finally, traditional genetic engineering has been the subject of much controversy due to concerns about safety and potential unintended consequences. CRISPR, while still relatively new and untested, has the potential to avoid many of these concerns by allowing for precise and targeted editing of specific genes.In summary, CRISPR differs from traditional genetic engineering in that it allows for precise editing of an organism’s own DNA, without the need for foreign genetic material, and uses a safer and more precise delivery mechanism. While both technologies have potential benefits and risks, CRISPR represents a major step forward in the field of genetic engineering.CRISPR technology really has the potential to revolutionize the field of food microbiology by allowing scientists to precisely manipulate the genomes of foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, and probiotics. Here are some applications of CRISPR in food microbiology:Pathogen detection: CRISPR-based diagnostic tests can be developed to quickly and accurately detect foodborne pathogens, such asSalmonella,Listeria, andE. coli, in food samples. This can help prevent outbreaks of foodborne illness by allowing for rapid identification and response.Pathogen control: CRISPR can be used to modify the genomes of foodborne pathogens to make them less virulent or more susceptible to antibiotics. This could be used to reduce the risk of foodborne illness by decreasing the ability of pathogens to cause disease.Spoilage prevention: CRISPR can be used to modify the genomes of spoilage organisms, such as yeast and bacteria, to increase their tolerance to environmental stressors, such as temperature and pH. This could help prevent food spoilage and extend the shelf life of food products.Probiotic engineering: CRISPR can be used to modify the genomes of probiotics, such as lactic acid bacteria, to enhance their health benefits. For example, probiotics could be engineered to produce specific bioactive compounds that promote gut health.Crop improvement: CRISPR can be used to modify the genomes of crops to enhance their resistance to pests and disease, increase their nutritional value, and improve their yield. This could help address global food security challenges by increasing the productivity and sustainability of agriculture.While the applications of CRISPR in food microbiology are still in the early stages of development, the technology has the potential to transform the way we approach food safety, quality, and nutrition. By enabling precise and targeted genetic manipulations, CRISPR could help address some of the most pressing challenges facing the food industry today.","food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Bacteria,"bacteria, probiotics-and-gut-health",Benefits of bifidobacteria,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/benefits-of-bifidobacteria/,"March 22, 2023","Bifidobacteria are a group of Gram-positive, anaerobic, and non-motile bacteria that are commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract. These are some important cellular and colonial characteristics, plus typical requirements for growth.Cellular characteristics:Bifidobacteria are rod-shaped bacteria with a length of 2-3 µm and a width of 0.5-1 µm.They are non-spore-forming and non-flagellated.They have a thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell wall and lack an outer membrane.They are able to ferment carbohydrates and produce lactic acid, acetic acid, and other organic acids.Colony characteristics:Bifidobacteria form white or cream-colored colonies on agar plates.The colonies are typically small (0.5-1.0 mm in diameter) and convex with a smooth surface.Bifidobacteria colonies are often surrounded by a clear zone of inhibition due to the production of organic acids that inhibit the growth of other bacteria.Growth requirements:Bifidobacteria are obligate anaerobes, meaning they require an oxygen-free environment to grow.They grow best at a pH of 6.0-7.0 and at a temperature of 37 °C.Bifidobacteria are fastidious bacteria and require a complex medium containing a variety of nutrients such as amino acids, vitamins, and minerals to grow.They are able to utilize a wide range of carbohydrates, including lactose, fructose, and oligosaccharides.There are more than 50 known species of bifidobacteria, but some of the most common and well-studied species include:Bifidobacterium adolescentis… from the human large intestine, and is known for its ability to break down complex carbohydrates.Bifidobacterium animalis… from intestinal tracts of animals, but can also be found in human faeces. It has been shown to have probiotic properties and is used in many commercial probiotic products.Bifidobacterium bifidum… from the human large intestine and is one of the first bacteria to colonise the gut of infants. It has been shown to have beneficial effects on the immune system and may help prevent gastrointestinal infections.Bifidobacterium breve… from human milk and has been shown to be beneficial for the health of infants. It has also been shown to have probiotic properties in adults.Bifidobacterium lactis… from dairy products and is used in many commercial probiotic products. It has been shown to have beneficial effects on the immune system and may help alleviate symptoms of lactose intolerance.Bifidobacterium longum… from the human gastrointestinal tract and has been shown to have probiotic properties. It may help improve gut health and alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.Figure 1:B. longumsubsp.longum… colonial morphology (A), cellular morphology (B) and SEM image (C) – image source: Zhao et al. (2021) in Frontiers of Microbiology 12:756519.Several species of bifidobacteria are commonly used as probiotics in food and supplements, including:Bifidobacterium bifidum(Figure 2)Bifidobacterium lactisBifidobacterium longum(Figure 1)Bifidobacterium animalissubsp.lactisBifidobacterium breveBifidobacterium infantisFigure 2: SEM image ofB. bifidum– image source: Ali et al. (2015) in the Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research 13:843.These species have been shown to have probiotic properties and may help support digestive health, boost the immune system, and alleviate certain gastrointestinal conditions. However, the effectiveness of specific strains and doses of bifidobacteria as probiotics may vary depending on the individual and the specific health condition being targeted.  Here are some of the potential human health benefits of bifidobacteria:Digestive health: Maintain digestive health by producing enzymes that help break down complex carbohydrates, and by producing lactic acid and other compounds that help create a favorable environment for beneficial bacteria to thrive.Immune system support: Modulate the immune system, potentially reducing the risk of allergies, infections, and autoimmune diseases.Mental health: Produce neurotransmitters such as 4-aminobutanoic acid (commonly referred to as GABA) and serotonin, which can help regulate mood and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression.Metabolic health: Improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and improve lipid profiles, potentially reducing the risk of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.Infant health: Bifidobacteria are among the first bacteria to colonize the gut of infants, and have been shown to play a key role in promoting healthy development of the immune system, digestive system, and brain.There’s no doubt that bifidobacteria are important members of the human gut microbiota, and they have been associated with a number of digestive health benefits. Bifidobacteria may also help reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea associated with antibiotic use, as demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial (Szajewska, Kołodziej, & Gieruszczak-Białek, 2015).We may not think of gut microbiota as playing a role in mental health, but indeed they do.  It is understood that bifidobacteria may regulate mood and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression by producing certain neurotransmitters, such as GABA and serotonin.  For example, it’s been found thatBifidobacterium infantisadministration to rats resulted in increased GABA receptor expression in the brain, leading to a reduction in anxiety-like behavior (Bravo et al., 2011). In humans, results from a randomized controlled trial were that administration of a probiotic mixture containingBifidobacterium bifidum,Bifidobacterium lactis, andLactobacillus acidophilusfor four weeks significantly reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to placebo (Messaoudi et al., 2011a). In another study, the results indicated that administration of a probiotic containingBifidobacterium longumandLactobacillus helveticusfor eight weeks improved mood and cognitive function in healthy volunteers (Messaoudi et al., 2011b).References:Bravo, J.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality",Ohmic heating in food processing,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/ohmic-heating-in-food-processing/,"March 16, 2023","Traditional food processing has relied on heat, which is particularly energy intensive.  So much energy is required and thus thermal processing is not environmentally sustainable.  Therefore, it is in the best interests of our planet to look at non-thermal processing techniques that can ultimately reduce our need for energy to produce safe food with a long shelf-life. Many non-thermal technologies have been investigated over the past 100+ years, but few are commercially available, and even fewer are in widespread use.  High pressure processing is one of the best success stories of non-thermal food processing technologies.  Ohmic heating isn’t widely known, yet is another technology with great potential to continue to a reduction in energy consumption. Let’s learn about it here…Ohmic heating, also known as Joule heating or electrical resistance heating, is a novel thermal processing technology that has been gaining popularity in the food industry in recent years. The process involves the application of an electric current to a food product, which results in the conversion of electrical energy into heat energy. Ohmic heating is considered a non-thermal processing method because it does not rely on external heating sources such as steam, hot air or hot water, but instead relies on the inherent resistance of the food to electric current to generate heat.The principle behind ohmic heating is based on the Joule effect, which describes the phenomenon of energy conversion that occurs when an electric current passes through a material with resistance. According to Ohm’s law, the current passing through a material is directly proportional to the voltage applied and inversely proportional to the resistance of the material. Therefore, if an electric current is passed through a material with resistance, such as food, heat will be generated due to the conversion of electrical energy into thermal energy.In the context of food processing, ohmic heating is typically achieved by passing an electric current through a food product that is placed between two electrodes. The electrodes are usually made of stainless steel and are positioned in such a way that the food product is in direct contact with them. When the electric current is applied, the food product heats up rapidly due to its resistance to the current, and the temperature is controlled by adjusting the voltage and current settings of the system.One of the main advantages of ohmic heating is its ability to provide rapid and uniform heating throughout the food product. Since the heat is generated directly within the food, there is no need for external heating sources, which can result in longer processing times and uneven heating. Ohmic heating can also be used to control the texture and color of food products, as well as to preserve the nutritional content of foods that are sensitive to high temperatures.Another advantage of ohmic heating is its ability to reduce the processing time required to achieve a desired level of microbial inactivation. The rapid heating provided by ohmic heating can lead to a significant reduction in the processing time required to achieve a desired level of microbial inactivation compared to traditional thermal processing methods. This is because ohmic heating can rapidly heat the food product to a high enough temperature to destroy microorganisms without causing significant thermal damage to the food itself.Ohmic heating has been successfully used in the processing of a variety of food products, including fruits and vegetables, meat and poultry, dairy products, and ready-to-eat meals. In the processing of fruits and vegetables, ohmic heating has been shown to be effective in reducing enzymatic activity and preserving the colour and texture of the products. In the processing of meat and poultry, ohmic heating has been shown to be effective in reducing the microbial load of the products while preserving their sensory quality. In the processing of dairy products, ohmic heating has been shown to be effective in reducing the heat load on the products, which can result in a longer shelf life.One of the challenges associated with ohmic heating is the development of suitable equipment that can withstand the high voltages and currents required for the process. The design of the electrodes is critical to the success of the process, as they must be able to withstand the high temperatures and pressures that can be generated during ohmic heating. Additionally, the electrical conductivity and resistance of the food product can vary depending on a number of factors, such as moisture content, pH, and salt content, which can make it difficult to achieve consistent heating throughout the product.In order to overcome these challenges, researchers are working to develop new electrode materials and designs that can withstand the rigors of ohmic heating, as well as new monitoring and control systems that can accurately measure the temperature and conductivity of the food product during processing.","food microbiology, food preservation, food processing, Food safety, foodborne disease"

These are my absolute favourites in the disciplines I hold nearest and dearest to my heart.  I have been a student of biochemistry and microbiology, lectured in these subject areas and been a researcher too in bacterial physiology, enzymology and protein chemistry.  So really, biochemistry and microbiology are the disciplines at the core of my scientific expertise.To me, the right book just inspires and excites.  Choose the wrong book, and an exciting topic becomes dull and boring.  These books just bring alive the exciting world of biochemistry and microbiology in a logical way through easy-to-read text, appropriate tables and figures and a natural flow of topics.  Some books just don’t do that.If you wish to buy a book in these subject areas, I very highly recommend these titles.  Furthermore, if you follow these links to buy them on Amazon, then I’ll earn a commission, at no extra cost to yourself.  Every so often, I’ll introduce and describe some products that I love and wholeheartedly support.  Then, I’ll move them to a dedicated page on my website here for products I love and how to buy them.  Please support Food Microbiology Academy and buy your books, and other products I recommend, through here!  Many thanks…Bailey and Scott’s Diagnostic MicrobiologyI used this book as a 3rd-year undergraduate student of clinical microbiology at James Cook University (Townsville, Queensland, Australia) in 1997.  While it wasn’t full of fancy colours, at least not then, it was packed with tables and all the absolutely necessary information about microorganisms of clinical significance.Prescott’s MicrobiologyIn 2008, I was the sole lecturer for a 1st-year subject introductory microbiology subject in the biotechnology Bachelor degree course at Box Hill Institute in Melbourne.  When it came time to select the prescribed textbook for my students, there was no doubt in my mind, of course it was going to be Prescott’s Microbiology.Stryer’s BiochemistryWhile I’ve never used it as a student or a lecturer, Stryer has always been my first choice reference source for general and introductory biochemistry.

Bacteria,bacteria,Pathogenicity and virulence of Escherichia coli,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/pathogenicity-and-virulence-of-escherichia-coli/,"February 23, 2023","PathogenicEscherichia coli(E. coli) are classified into several categories based on the virulence factors they possess. Some of the most common types are:EnterotoxigenicE. coli(ETEC) – Causes diarrhea in travelers and in developing countries.Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) – Causes diarrhea, especially in young children.EnteroaggregativeE. coli(EAEC) – Also causes diarrhea, often associated with malnutrition and poor hygiene.Shiga toxin-producingE. coli(STEC) – Causes severe foodborne illness, including Hemorrhagic Colitis (HC) and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS).Extraintestinal pathogenicE. coli(ExPEC) – Causes urinary tract infections, sepsis, and other infections outside the gut.It is important to note that not all strains ofE. coliare pathogenic, and many are even beneficial to the human gut.EnterotoxigenicEscherichia coli(ETEC)– Produce and secrete one or more enterotoxins that disrupt the normal function of the gut and cause watery diarrhea. The enterotoxins produced by ETEC are called heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxin (ST), which mimic the action of the human gut hormones and stimulate fluid secretion, leading to diarrhea.LT targets the small intestine and stimulates excessive secretion of chloride ions into the lumen of the gut, causing osmotic diarrhea. ST targets the large intestine and stimulates the production of prostaglandins, leading to increased secretion of fluid and electrolytes into the gut lumen.In addition to the enterotoxins, ETEC can also attach to the surface of the gut epithelium and interfere with the normal function of the gut, causing inflammation and damage to the gut lining. This can lead to decreased nutrient absorption and dehydration, which can become life-threatening in severe cases, especially in young children, elderly individuals, and those with weakened immune systems.Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC)– Attach to the intestinal epithelium and induce changes in the host cell cytoskeleton, leading to the formation of a characteristic lesion known as “attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion.”The attachment of EPEC to the gut epithelium is facilitated by a type of adhesion molecule known as “bundle-forming pilus” (BFP). This allows the bacteria to form a close association with the host cells and secrete effector proteins that alter the cytoskeleton and disrupt the normal function of the gut.The alterations in the host cell cytoskeleton caused by EPEC result in the characteristic A/E lesion, which leads to the detachment of the bacteria from the gut epithelium and their release into the gut lumen, allowing them to spread to other parts of the gut and cause further damage.The A/E lesion and the release of bacterial products into the gut can also stimulate an immune response and cause inflammation, leading to diarrhea and other symptoms of disease. EPEC infection is most commonly seen in young children, but can also occur in adults, particularly in developing countries where hygiene and sanitation conditions may be poor.EnteroaggregativeEscherichia coli(EAEC)– Form biofilm-like aggregates on the gut epithelium, which can cause chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and malnutrition.EAEC are able to attach to the gut epithelium and form large clusters, which can cause the gut to become inflamed and result in the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other toxic substances. The aggregates can also interfere with the normal functioning of the gut, leading to decreased nutrient absorption and fluid secretion, leading to diarrhea.In addition to the aggregates, EAEC can also produce a range of virulence factors, including cytotoxins, hemolysins, and adhesins, which can further damage the gut and contribute to the symptoms of disease.EAEC infections are most commonly seen in young children, particularly in developing countries where hygiene and sanitation conditions may be poor. They can also occur in adults, especially in individuals with weakened immune systems or who have recently traveled to areas with poor hygiene and sanitation.Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia coli(STEC)– Produce and secrete Shiga toxins, which can damage the gut and cause severe foodborne illness, including Hemorrhagic Colitis (HC) and Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS).STEC produce two types of Shiga toxins, called Stx1 and Stx2, which are toxic to human cells and can cause extensive damage to the gut, leading to diarrhea and other symptoms of HC. The toxins can also enter the bloodstream and cause damage to other organs, leading to HUS, a serious and potentially life-threatening complication.HUS is characterized by the formation of small blood clots in the small blood vessels of the body, which can lead to reduced blood flow and damage to organs, including the kidney, brain, and heart. HUS can cause a range of symptoms, including decreased urine output, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, seizures and coma.STEC infections are typically contracted through the consumption of contaminated food, including undercooked meat, raw milk, and contaminated fruits and vegetables. They can also be spread through person-to-person contact, particularly in outbreaks linked to food preparation and handling.Extraintestinal pathogenicEscherichia coli(ExPEC)– TheseE. colicause disease outside of the gastrointestinal tract, in other parts of the body such as the urinary tract, bloodstream, and other organs. They are typically responsible for a range of infections, including urinary tract infections (UTIs), sepsis, and meningitis.ExPEC are able to cause disease by producing a range of virulence factors, including adhesins, fimbriae, toxins, and enzymes, which allow the bacteria to colonize and infect various tissues in the body. The virulence factors produced by ExPEC can also contribute to the pathogenesis of disease by causing inflammation, damaging host cells, and disrupting normal host processes.UTIs are the most common type of infection caused by ExPEC, and are characterized by symptoms such as painful urination, cloudy urine, and lower abdominal pain. ExPEC can also cause sepsis, a severe and potentially life-threatening systemic infection, and meningitis, an inflammation of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord.ExPEC infections are typically acquired through the spread of bacteria from the gut to other parts of the body, or through the introduction of bacteria into the body through a break in the skin or a medical procedure. They can also be spread through person-to-person contact, particularly in outbreaks linked to health care facilities.","food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, microbiology, pathogen"
Bacteria,"bacteria, public-health",Is our food supply becoming less safe?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/is-our-food-supply-becoming-less-safe/,"February 17, 2023","A question that is not uncommon, especially from critics of contemporary food production, manufacturing and distribution.  Yes, it is a legitimate question, and one that is certainly valid, but certainly one that is particularly complex.  It is difficult to make a blanket statement about the overall safety of the food supply as it can vary by country and region. However, there have been concerns about food safety in recent years, such as the rise in food recalls and outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. Factors such as industrialization of agriculture, globalization of the food supply, and changes in consumer preferences can also play a role in food safety. It’s important for individuals to take steps to protect themselves, such as practicing proper food handling and preparation techniques, and staying informed about food recalls and outbreaks in their area.The history of food regulations and food standards in the 19th and 20th centuries has been marked by both progress and setbacks in ensuring the safety of the food supply.In the 19th century, the industrialisation of food production and the growth of cities led to increased concerns about the safety and purity of food. This led to the creation of early food regulations, such as the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 in the United States, which aimed to prevent the sale of adulterated or mislabeled food.However, these early regulations were often inadequate and poorly enforced, which led to continued problems with food safety. For example, the use of harmful chemicals such as lead and copper in food products was not adequately regulated, and many food products were adulterated with cheaper ingredients.In the 20th century, food safety regulations improved with the introduction of better scientific methods for detecting and preventing foodborne illness. The development of pasteurisation and refrigeration, along with the creation of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) improved the food safety.However, the regulations also had some negative consequences. For example, the use of pesticides and other chemicals in agriculture increased, which led to concerns about the safety of these substances and their potential impacts on human health and the environment. Additionally, the industrialization of food production led to the concentration of food production in a few large companies, which made the food supply more vulnerable to contamination.In summary, while food regulations and standards have improved over time, they have not always been sufficient to ensure the safety of the food supply and some regulations have even contributed to making food unsafe in the past. Food safety is a complex issue that requires ongoing attention, research and improvement to ensure the safety of the food supply for all.Governments take various actions to address food safety and foodborne disease outbreaks. Some of the actions that governments may take include:Implementing food safety regulations: Governments may establish and enforce regulations that set standards for the production, processing, and distribution of food. These regulations may cover issues such as food hygiene, food labeling, and the use of pesticides and other chemicals.Establishing food safety agencies: Governments may establish agencies responsible for enforcing food safety regulations and investigating foodborne disease outbreaks. These agencies may also provide education and training to food producers and processors to help them comply with regulations.Conducting surveillance and outbreak investigations: Governments may conduct surveillance for foodborne disease outbreaks and investigate outbreaks when they occur. This may involve collecting and analyzing data on illnesses and deaths, identifying the source of the outbreak, and taking action to control the spread of the disease.Developing food safety guidelines and recommendations: Governments may develop guidelines and recommendations to help food producers, processors, and consumers reduce their risk of foodborne illness.Increasing food import and export inspection: Governments may increase their inspections on food imports and exports to ensure that the food meets safety standards.Collaborating with international organizations: Governments may collaborate with international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to share information and coordinate efforts to address food safety and foodborne disease outbreaks.It’s important to note that the actions taken by governments may vary depending on the country or region, and the level of resources available to them.There are several global trends in foodborne disease that have been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations. Some of these include:An increase in the number of reported foodborne outbreaks: This is likely due to improved surveillance and reporting systems, as well as an increase in the globalization of the food supply.A shift in the types of pathogens causing foodborne illness: In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of outbreaks caused by non-traditional foodborne pathogens such as norovirus and Shiga toxin-producingE. coli(STEC), which are more difficult to detect and control than traditional pathogens likeSalmonellaandE. coliO157:H7.An increase in the number of multi-country outbreaks: The globalization of the food supply has led to an increase in the number of outbreaks that affect multiple countries, making them more difficult to control and investigate.An increase in the number of outbreaks linked to fresh produce: This is likely due to the increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as changes in agricultural practices that can increase the risk of contamination.A rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR): The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in agriculture can lead to the development of AMR, which can make it more difficult to control foodborne pathogens and treat infections.It’s important to note that these trends are subject to change over time and may vary depending on the region or country.","food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Bacteria,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Prebiotics and your gut microflora,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prebiotics-and-your-gut-microflora/,"February 10, 2023","The gut microflora is a diverse community of microorganisms that live in the gastrointestinal tract. It is composed of a variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms. The most prevalent and well-studied bacteria in the gut microflora are from the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.Examples of bacteria in the gut microflora include:Bifidobacterium: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut and is thought to have a number of health benefits, including improved digestion, a stronger immune system, and a reduced risk of certain diseases.Lactobacillus: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in fermented foods such as yogurt and kefir, and is also used as a probiotic supplement.Escherichia coli(E. coli): a type of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut and is important for maintaining a healthy gut microflora. Some strains ofE. coliare beneficial, while others can cause infections.Clostridium: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut, and is important for the digestion of carbohydrates.Bacteroides: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut, and is important for breaking down complex carbohydrates and proteins.It’s important to note that the gut microflora is a complex ecosystem and the number and type of bacteria present can vary greatly depending on factors such as diet, age, genetics, and overall health.Probiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed. The concept of using live microorganisms to promote health dates back to the early 20th century, when the Russian scientist Elie Metchnikoff observed that certain rural populations had longer lifespans and less incidence of disease than urban populations. He attributed this to their consumption of fermented dairy products, which he believed contained beneficial microorganisms. In the decades that followed, researchers began to isolate and study specific strains of microorganisms that they believed to have health benefits, leading to the development of probiotic supplements and products. Today, probiotics are available in a wide variety of forms, including capsules, tablets, powders, and fermented foods.Prebiotics are non-digestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the gut. They act as food for probiotics, helping to increase their numbers and improve their function.Examples of prebiotics include:Inulin: a type of fructan found in many fruits and vegetables, including onions, garlic, leeks, and asparagus.Oligosaccharides: a group of carbohydrates that includes fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). These can be found in a variety of foods, such as chicory root, Jerusalem artichokes, and soybeans.Resistant starches: a type of starch that is not broken down and absorbed in the small intestine, but instead reaches the large intestine where it can be fermented by gut bacteria. Examples include potatoes, green bananas, and legumes.Lactose: a sugar found in milk and dairy products, which is fermented by gut bacteria.Prebiotics are often added to food products such as yogurt, cereal, and energy bars, as well as supplements. They can also be found naturally in many fruits, vegetables and whole grains.Prebiotics are important for probiotic bacteria and the gut microflora because they provide a source of energy and nutrients that the beneficial microorganisms can use to grow and thrive. When prebiotics reach the large intestine, they are fermented by the gut bacteria, which produces short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate and butyrate that are essential for gut health.Prebiotics also help to promote a diverse and balanced gut microflora, which is important for maintaining gut health. A diverse gut microflora is associated with a healthy immune system, better nutrient absorption, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease.Additionally, prebiotics can improve the function of probiotics by helping to protect them from being broken down by stomach acid and bile, and also by providing an environment that supports their growth and survival.In summary, prebiotics play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy gut by providing a food source for beneficial gut bacteria, promoting diversity and balance of gut microflora, and protecting probiotic bacteria from degradation.The recommended daily intake of prebiotics varies depending on the specific type of prebiotic and the individual’s health status. However, a general guideline is to consume between 5-10 grams of prebiotics per day.It is also important to note that it is not necessary to consume prebiotics in the form of supplements, as they can be found naturally in many fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Examples of prebiotic-rich foods include:Jerusalem artichokesDandelion greensGarlicOnionsLeeksAsparagusBananas (ripe)Whole wheatBarleyOatsApplesBerriesIt is also important to note that it is best to consume a variety of prebiotic-rich foods to ensure that you are getting a diverse range of prebiotics to promote a diverse and balanced gut microflora.It is also worth noting that consuming too much prebiotics can cause digestive discomfort such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea. It’s best to start with small amounts and gradually increase the intake to see how your body reacts. Additionally, if you have any specific health conditions, it’s best to consult with a health professional before increasing your prebiotic intake.","food microbiology, food science, gut health, gut microflora, probiotics"
Bacteria,bacteria,"Techniques of molecular food microbiology. Part 2 – MLST, PFGE and WGS.",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/techniques-of-molecular-food-microbiology-part-2-mlst-pfge-and-wgs/,"February 4, 2023","Multi locus sequence typing (MLST) is a technique that has been used in food microbiology, to identify and track specific strains of microorganisms associated with foodborne disease outbreaks. MLST is a method of sequencing a defined set of genetic loci across the genome of a microorganism, which can be used to identify the specific strain of a microorganism.MLST is still considered a useful technique in food microbiology, especially in some specific microorganisms such asSalmonellaand Listeria, and it is often used in combination with other techniques, such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) or whole genome sequencing (WGS), to provide a more complete view of the genetic makeup of a microorganism.MLST is a powerful tool for tracking the spread of microorganisms in food chains and for identifying the source of food-borne outbreaks. It is also useful for monitoring the evolution of microorganisms, such as the emergence of new subtypes or strains. However, MLST also has some limitations, such as the need for large amounts of bacterial culture, the need for high-quality genomic DNA, and the subjectivity of band interpretation.In recent years, WGS has emerged as a powerful alternative to MLST, as it allows for a more complete view of the genetic makeup of a microorganism and it has the ability to detect genetic variations at a higher resolution. WGS is faster, more accurate, and more cost-effective than MLST and it can be used to identify new strains or subtypes of microorganisms that may have different properties or behaviors.Therefore, while MLST is still considered as a useful technique in food microbiology, it is being replaced by WGS as the primary method of subtyping microorganisms in food microbiology.Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is a technique that has been used in the past in epidemiological tracking of foodborne disease outbreaks. PFGE is a method of separating large DNA fragments using an electric field that is periodically changed in direction, which causes the DNA fragments to migrate through the gel in a random fashion. This results in a unique banding pattern for each strain of a microorganism, which can be used to identify and track specific strains of microorganisms associated with a foodborne disease outbreak.PFGE is still considered a gold standard for subtyping certain bacteria such asSalmonella,ListeriaandE. coliO157:H7. PFGE has been used extensively by public health laboratories to track foodborne disease outbreaks and to identify the sources of contamination. However, this method has some limitations, such as the need for large amounts of bacterial culture, the need for high-quality genomic DNA, and the subjectivity of band interpretation.In recent years, Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has emerged as a powerful alternative to PFGE. WGS is a more high-resolution technique that can provide a more complete view of the genetic makeup of a microorganism. WGS is faster, more accurate, and more cost-effective than PFGE, and it can be used to identify new strains or subtypes of microorganisms that may have different properties or behaviors.Therefore, while PFGE is still considered as a useful technique in epidemiological tracking of foodborne disease outbreaks, it is being replaced by WGS as the primary method of subtyping microorganisms in food microbiology.Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a powerful analytical technique that can be used in food microbiology to study microorganisms present in food. WGS involves sequencing the entire DNA of a microorganism, which provides a high-resolution view of its genetic makeup. This allows for a more complete understanding of the microorganism’s biology and its potential impact on food safety and quality.Compared to other molecular techniques, such as PCR and MALDI-TOF MS, WGS has several benefits in food microbiology:High resolution: WGS provides a more detailed view of the genetic makeup of a microorganism, which can be used to identify new strains or subtypes of microorganisms that may have different properties or behaviors.Identification of virulence factors: WGS can be used to identify genes associated with virulence factors, such as toxins, that can cause food-borne illness.Detection of antibiotic resistance: WGS can be used to detect the presence of genes associated with antibiotic resistance in microorganisms present in food. This information can be used to monitor the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the food supply and to guide the development of new food safety measures.Identification of genetic diversity: WGS can be used to identify genetic diversity among microorganisms, which can be important for understanding the evolution and spread of microorganisms in food.Traceability: WGS can also be used to track the origin of food products, such as meat, dairy, and seafood, by identifying the specific microorganisms present at each step of the food production process.Phylogenetic analysis: WGS allows for the identification of relatedness among different microorganisms, providing a more accurate way of identifying the origin of outbreaks and also useful in tracking the spread of certain microorganisms in food chains.Comparative genomics: WGS also allows for the comparison of multiple genomes, enabling researchers to identify genetic changes that may have occurred in microorganisms, for example, adaptation to specific environments such as food matrices.Cost-effective: WGS is becoming more cost-effective due to the decreasing cost of sequencing. This makes it more accessible to a wider range of researchers and food industry professionals.","food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, genomics, microbiology, molecular biology"

Part 1: PCR,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/techniques-of-molecular-food-microbiology-part-1-pcr/,"January 30, 2023","Molecular food microbiology is a field of study that utilizes molecular biology techniques to understand the microorganisms present in food, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These techniques include PCR, DNA sequencing, and gene expression analysis, which allow for the identification, characterization, and quantification of microorganisms in food. The goal of molecular food microbiology is to improve the safety, quality, and shelf-life of food products by studying the microorganisms that can cause spoilage or food-borne illness. This knowledge can be used to design better food preservation methods and to develop new food safety guidelines.Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique that is used to amplify a specific segment of DNA. It was first described by Kary Mullis in 1983, and since then it has been widely used in various fields, including food microbiology. In food microbiology, PCR is used to detect and identify specific microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, in food samples. It is also used to detect and identify specific genetic markers associated with food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella and E. coli. PCR has become an important tool in food safety and quality control, as it can quickly and accurately detect the presence of harmful microorganisms in food. Additionally, PCR-based methods have been used to authenticate the origin of food products, such as meat and dairy products.Some of the main applications of PCR in food microbiology include:Identification of microorganisms: PCR can be used to identify the specific microorganisms present in a food sample, such as E. coli, Salmonella, and Listeria. This information can be used to track the source of food-borne illness outbreaks and to monitor the effectiveness of food safety measures.Quantification of microorganisms: PCR can be used to quantify the number of microorganisms present in a food sample. This information can be used to assess the level of contamination in food products and to monitor the effectiveness of food preservation methods.Detection of antibiotic resistance: PCR can be used to detect the presence of genes associated with antibiotic resistance in microorganisms present in food. This information can be used to monitor the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the food supply and to guide the development of new food safety measures.Traceability: PCR can also be used to track the origin of food products, such as meat, dairy, and seafood, by identifying the specific microorganisms present at each step of the food production process.Detection of food fraud: PCR can be used to detect the presence of specific microorganisms or genetic markers that indicate the origin of food products, which can be used to detect food fraud, such as the mislabeling of products or the use of lower-quality ingredients.Detection of pathogenic microorganisms: PCR can be used to detect pathogenic microorganisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, and Salmonella spp., that cause food-borne illness.Prototype polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine (prototype – object genre)byUnknown makeris licensed underCC-BY-NC-SA 4.0There are several types of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) that are commonly used in food microbiology to detect and identify microorganisms present in food samples. These include:Traditional PCR: This is the most basic form of PCR, which amplifies a specific DNA sequence using a set of primers that bind to the ends of the target sequence.Real-time PCR: This is a variation of PCR that allows for the quantification of the target DNA sequence in real-time, by measuring the amount of PCR product as it is produced.Multiplex PCR: This is a PCR method that allows for the simultaneous amplification of multiple DNA sequences using multiple sets of primers.Nested PCR: This is a PCR method that involves two rounds of amplification, with the second round using a set of primers that bind within the amplified product of the first round. This allows for the detection of low levels of target DNA and to improve the specificity of the PCR assay.Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR): This method is used to amplify RNA sequences, which are converted to cDNA by reverse transcription before the PCR amplification. It is used to detect and quantify RNA viruses, such as norovirus in food samples.Quantitative PCR (qPCR): This is a variation of PCR that allows for the quantification of the target DNA sequence. qPCR can be used to determine the amount of a specific microorganism in a sample, which can be useful in monitoring the effectiveness of food preservation methods.Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP): This is a PCR method that is used to amplify DNA sequences at a constant temperature, which can be useful for the detection of microorganisms in field settings.PCR-ELISA: This is a PCR method that combines the specificity of PCR with the sensitivity of ELISA, which is used to detect the presence of specific microorganisms or genetic markers in food samples.The choice of the PCR method will depend on the type of microorganism being targeted, the sample matrix, and the available equipment and expertise.KSC-2015-2377byNASAKennedyis licensed underCC-BY-NC 2.0","food microbiology, Food safety, food science, microbiology, molecular biology, PCR, polymerase chain reaction"
Bacteria,"bacteria, food-safety, public-health",Aeromonas hydrophila – is it worth worrying about?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/aeromonas-hydrophila-is-it-worth-worrying-about/,"January 25, 2023","Aeromonas hydrophilais a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the family Aeromonadaceae. It was first identified by a Japanese scientist in 1892 and is considered as one of the first species of the genusAeromonas.   The genus Aeromonas, is composed of several species,Aeromonas hydrophilais one of the most well-known and studied species in this genus.  It is important to note that,Aeromonas hydrophilais considered a complex species, meaning that it is composed of several sub-groups with different levels of pathogenic potential, which can cause different types of infections in humans and animals.Taxonomically,Aeromonas hydrophilafalls under the following classification:Domain: BacteriaPhylum: ProteobacteriaClass: GammaproteobacteriaOrder: AeromonadalesFamily: AeromonadaceaeGenus:AeromonasSpecies:Aeromonas hydrophilaThis species is commonly found in freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. It can also be found in brackish water and in the intestinal tracts of some fish species. In fish,Aeromonas hydrophilacan cause a variety of diseases, including septicemia, wound infections, and fin and tail rot. Symptoms of a fish infected withAeromonas hydrophilamay include redness, swelling, and ulceration of the skin, as well as fin and tail damage. It’s important to maintain good water quality and hygiene in fish tanks and aquaculture systems to prevent the spread ofAeromonas hydrophilaand other fish diseases. If your fish are showing signs of infection, it’s best to consult a veterinarian or fish health expert for proper diagnosis and treatment.  The presence ofAeromonas hydrophilain the aquatic environment is not necessarily a cause for concern, as the bacteria is a normal part of the aquatic microbial community. However, high levels of the bacteria in water or fish may indicate poor water quality or overcrowding in aquaculture systems, which can lead to increased risk of disease in fish and other aquatic animals.A. hydrophilacan cause foodborne illness in humans, although it is less common than other foodborne pathogens such asSalmonellaandE. coli. The bacteria can be found in raw or undercooked meat and seafood, as well as in fresh produce that has been contaminated with water or sewage. Aeromonas hydrophila can also survive and grow in refrigerated foods, making it important to store and handle food properly to prevent the growth and spread of the bacteria.Symptoms ofAeromonas hydrophilainfection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever. These symptoms usually appear within 24 to 48 hours after consuming contaminated food. In severe cases, Aeromonas hydrophila infection can lead to dehydration and blood infections.To prevent foodborne illness caused byAeromonas hydrophila, it is important to handle food properly, cook meat and seafood thoroughly, and to practice good personal hygiene. It is also important to properly clean and sanitize cutting boards and other kitchen tools to prevent cross-contamination.AlthoughAeromonas hydrophilais a rare cause of foodborne illness, there have been several reported outbreaks of disease associated with the bacteria in recent years.In 2019, United Kingdom, over 30 cases. Cause: raw or undercooked meat from a local butcher shop.In 2018, United States, over 20 cases. Cause: raw or undercooked pork products from a local distributor.In 2017, Germany, over 50 cases. Cause: raw or undercooked fish products from a local market.In 2015, United States, over 20 cases. Cause: raw oysters harvested from a local estuary.These are just a few examples of reported outbreaks involvingAeromonas hydrophila, it’s important to note that most cases of foodborne illness caused byAeromonasare not reported or recognized, it is usually underdiagnosed due to its similarity to other enteric pathogens.Aeromonas hydrophilacan be identified in the microbiology laboratory using a variety of methods, including cultural, biochemical, serological, and molecular techniques.Cultural methods involve growing the bacteria on selective and differential media, such as thiosulfate-citrate-bile-sucrose (TCBS) agar or cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (CIN) agar, which are formulated to selectively promote the growth ofAeromonasspecies while inhibiting the growth of other bacteria.Biochemical methods involve testing the bacteria’s ability to ferment various sugars or produce certain enzymes. For example,Aeromonashydrophila is able to ferment lactose and produce the enzyme catalase.Serological methods, such as the slide agglutination test, can be used to identifyAeromonas hydrophilaby detecting specific antigens in the bacteria.Molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing, can be used to specifically detect and identifyAeromonas hydrophilaby targeting specific genetic regions of the bacteria.It’s worth to note that,Aeromonas hydrophilais a part of theAeromonasgenus which encompasses a number of species, therefore it is important to use multiple methods to confirm the identification ofAeromonas hydrophilain the lab.","fish disease, food microbiology, food science, foodborne disease"

It’s like to be three monthly webinars, possibly over the Southern Hemisphere summer months of December, January and February.  If not the coming summer of 22/23, then quite likely the next summer of 23/24.Prebiotics, probiotics and fermented foods – they are separate and distinct, yet very much related, how so?  To get the most benefit from these three, it is essential to be clear on what they are, how they are similar, related and different.  Plus, how they relate to the other aspects of digestive or gut health as well as the gut microbiota, our microbiome altogether and indeed an appreciation, or at minimum, an acknowledgement or the wide-ranging influence the our gut health has on our overall and specific health and physiology.  While fermented foods date to antiquity, probiotics are a more recent concept, but are still certainly not new.  It really is just that they are returning to the fore, due to a heightened focus, not just on healthy eating and wellness, but on more natural approaches to maintaining a healthy homeostatic balance.  The immune system is a big topic at the moment, and our gut microbiota play a key immunomodulatory effect, in a very natural way.  How so and what can we do to maintain ourselves in top health by looking after our gut health?Well, probiotics are added ‘good’ and ‘friendly’ bacteria that are recognised, such as thorough clinical trials, to have a positive impact on the health of the person ingesting them.  Really though, probiotics could be thought of as a supplement, and shouldn’t really be necessary if you are looking after your natural and existing gut microbiome.  That’s where probiotics and fermented foods come in.  Prebiotics are really the nutrients that these gut bacteria require.  Various fibres that they thrive on, examples of which are inulin and especially the oligosaccharides known as GOS (galactic-oligosaccharides) and FOS (fructo-oligosaccharides).  These, and other prebiotic fibres, when consumed in appropriate quantities, should be able to sufficiently nourish your existing got microbiota.  This is the most natural approach, the simplest approach, and the ideal from the nutritional perspective too.  However, there might be times when your normal gut microbiome, which remember, can have an impact on various different parts of your body, might be negatively impacted by a range of circumstances.  These could include stress, a poor diet (or lifestyle overall) and/or taking of antibiotics.  Antibiotics in particular are bad news for your ‘friendly bacteria’ – once your antibiotics kill some of them off, your natural balance is disrupted and worst case scenario, the way is left open for invading pathogenic bacteria to establish.  Remember that your body constantly being challenged, whether it is by cancer cells or invading viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms.  Thus, with an out of balance gut microbial ecosystem, it’s only a matter of time that you become sick from the constant challenges of invading microorganisms.Under such circumstances, probiotics can be useful, either in foods, which may or may not be fermented, or as dietary supplements, like capsules and the like.  However, the best way to externally restore your gut microbial balance is with probiotic foods, which may or may not be fermented.  This is an important, really essential piece of understanding to gain here, which is – fermented foods are always going to be produced by microorganisms, because this is the nature of fermentation, it is a microbial process.  However, those fermented foods may or may not contain probiotics, even if the starter culture microorganisms are still present.  On the other hand, probiotic foods may or may not be fermented.  Today, there are many new and innovative probiotic food products that contain probiotics that are not fermented.  These have a range of probiotics added to them, essentially they are food additives.  A classic example is kombucha, the very popular and trending low to non-alcohol fermented beverage.  The natural fermenting starter cultures in kombucha are acetic acid bacteria.  Acetic acid bacteria do a fabulous job of fermenting sugars into acetic acid during the manufacturing process of kombucha.  While they are perfectly suited to fermentation in this context, they are not probiotic bacteria and will do nothing to improve the gut health or any other aspects of health, of the host.  Then, you might be asking, but I drink probiotic kombucha, it says probiotic on the label and it is a fermented drink.  Yes it is a fermented drink and yes it may be probiotic, but the two are unrelated.  This means that probiotics are added to kombucha.  The fermenting starter acetic acid bacteria cultures may or may not be present when you consume the drink, but it is irrelevant because they are not probiotics.We given an extremely brief overview here, but tried to convey the important consumer-related aspect of the difference and relatedness between probiotics foods/drinks and fermented foods/drinks, and how they are the same and different.","food microbiology, gut health, microbiology, probiotics"

Well, to get straight to the point here, your last meal is highly unlikely to have given you a dose of foodborne disease.  Let me explain…Firstly, foodborne illness or gastrointestinal disease can be either an infection or an intoxication.  Now, you might be thinking, huh? an intoxication? I’m not intoxicated, I didn’t drink (alcohol) or don’t drink, what is this guy on about.  Well, an intoxication is simply any disease caused by a toxin.  The toxin can be alcohol, ethanol to be precise, or it can be a toxin produced by a toxigenic bacterium – one of the more common ones would beStaphylococcus aureus, which produces multiple heat-stable toxins that can cause gastrointestinal intoxications.  Let us delve deeper, and understand how foodborne intoxications occur.  A food product already contains the bacterium or is contained during preparation from the food handler.  This is an especially common means of food contamination withS. aureus, just because it is so common as a normal inhabitant of people’s skin and nose, for example.  So now we haveS. aureusbacteria on/in the food.  If the food is left under conditions that allow the bacteria to grow, they do so, and produce toxin.  At this point, the food may be heated, which kills off the bacteria.  However, the toxin is heat-stable, or at least more thermostable than the vegetative cells, and they remain in the food product even though the vegetative bacterial cells are eliminated by the heat treatment.  When someone eats this food, they are consuming the toxin, but not the bacteria that have been killed by the heat treatment.  The food handler may be secure in their action of heating the food, and the effect it has in a food safety sense.  However, they are doing little to render the food safe.  Toxin remains, enough toxin to cause an intoxication disease.  Not too long after someone consumes the food, perhaps four to six hours later, they get sick as they have been ‘poisoned’ by the toxin, they have been intoxicated.  In this case, the food they consumed at they last meal was almost certainly responsible for this foodborne illness, but it has to be an intoxication, due to the extremely short timeframe of just a few hours.Now, let us consider foodborne infections.  Infections are different from intoxications as these diseases result from the growth of microorganisms inside our body.  Picture this as a typical scenario: An ingredient is used in the preparation of a home-cooked dish, the cooking process results in an undercooked ingredient, we eat that undercooked ingredient and consume the bacteria, which could be a pretty small amount or a large amount, the bacteria grow inside our body and make us sick.  This is an infection.  A common example might be meat, chicken for example, which is invariably contaminated withCampylobacter jejuneorSalmonella enterica, for example, from cross-contamination during the slaughtering and processing procedure.  If this chicken is consumed undercooked, some or many of the bacteria remain.  If consumed immediately, we may consume a small (or large) amount of the contamination microorganisms.  However, if the chicken is subjected to temperature abuse, then the bacteria will likely grow to high numbers within the chicken and we will consume this highly contaminated chicken without realising it.  You might say, hey hang on, I really do think I’m going to know if a food item is going to make by sick, I’ll know if it is “off”.  We,, that’s kind of a misconception, because almost without exception, you won’t know.  Foods unsafe to eat nearly always look, smell and taste normal.  The foods that are “off”, and noticeably spoiled, are those that have been overgrown by food spoilage microorganisms, bacteria or fungi, which are generally not capable of making you sick.  They are spoilage microorganisms and not pathogenic microorganisms, and therefore cannot make you sick, they just don’t have the capacity to do so. This brings me to my last point – how long does all this take?  …from point of consumption until you realise you have “gastro”?  An absolute minimum of 24 hours, but typically, 48 to 72 hours, and in some cases longer.  This is because it takes time for the bacteria to establish in your body and then to grow to high enough numbers that your immune system cannot overcome, which results in clinical disease.  So basically, once symptoms typical of that disease present, you have lost the battle.So there you have it, the difference between intoxications and infections in the context of foodborne disease.  Next time you have what seems like a bout of food poisoning, a foodborne disease, it would be better practice to case your mind back at least or three days, possible more, to identify any risky food safety situations you can recall.  Of course though, you may have COVID-19, which under rare circumstances, can present gastrointestinal symptoms.

Bacteria,bacteria,Quarter of a century of microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/quarter-of-a-century-of-microbiology/,"March 28, 2022","Although I (I being Philip Button) started my university studies in 1993 at The University of Queensland, it wasn’t until second semester of 1995, during a second year genetics class at Deakin University, that I discovered the wonders of microbiology.  I never knew much about microbiology, nor gave it much thought, but suddenly, the unseen world held a fascinating captivation for me.  Then, upon changing to James Cook University in 1996, I knew I wanted to major in microbiology, and so, late in February 1996, I took my first microbiology class, MI2011 “Introductory Microbiology”.Really, what I want to go over in this blog article are the changes to microbiology over the last quarter of a century of so.  Traditional microbiology, the classical culture methods were still very much the gold standard.  Yes, there were some molecular methods, but they certainly weren’t considered within the realm of routine, diagnostic microbiology.  They were very much for specialised, typically research applications.  So during 1996 and 1997, taking one subject after another of microbiology, my knowledge and understanding of bacterial identification was built on selective and differential media, colonial morphology and culture-based biochemical tests.  What we did have those, were these mini rapid methods, the API test strips, wow!  These were the highlights of undergraduate practical classes in microbiology and infectious diseases.By the time of my PhD studies, some five to ten years later, culture media and classical microbiology was of course still important, especially with the advent of chromogenic media.  However, there was a new kid on the block, molecular biology met microbiology and the true routine world of molecular microbiology was born.  Sure, it was a research application, but heck, I was doing it, so it can’t be that specialised and niche!  I’m talking about pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).  While restriction endonucleases had been used in routine molecular biology applications for some time, their use in bacterial identification, then running the DNA fragments on a gel for over 20 hours to return a unit strain-level pattern, wow alright, this was powerful!  Then we had PulseNet and the routine use of PFGE in epidemiological studies of strains during foodborne disease outbreaks in the US.  For the first time, we could easily pinpoint and track isolates at the strain level from their source, through the agrifood supply chain, to the point of infection.  What an amazing epidemiological tool.After my PhD, despite my love for microbiology, and bacteria in general, I moved in a different direction, away from microbiology, to biochemistry, then physical chemistry and materials science during my postdoctoral work and then into an even more unrelated area of information systems in the food and grocery retailing.  This meant I didn’t keep too up-to-date with the progress and advancements in microbiology.  Therefore, it was certainly a surprise to me when I found out that my old friend PFGE, the technique, the technology, that got me a book chapter published around ten years ago now, was obsolete.  Wow, how did we move on so quickly?  Then, as a replacement we have MALDT-TOF MS in diagnostic laboratories.  This was extremely privileged technology during my PhD, so privileged that there was no MALDI-TOF MS instrument at The University of Melbourne and I had to use a fee-for-service instrument at Monash University, at a cost of $100 a sample back around 2006/2007.  Moving on from that, we have NGS with WGS become routine today.  The speed of development of technological innovations in microbiology is truly amazing.  Honestly, I don’t feel like I’ve been a microbiologist for that long, and yet, I’ve seen all the above take place – from the days I used to streak blood agar plates and look for haemolytic reactions and other colony characteristics, to today, the age of routine genomics, proteomics and indeed, other -omics technologies that are rising in prominence.However, despite the ‘sexy’ new genomic and molecular techniques taking the entire scientific world by storm, microbiology included, there’s still something warm, fuzzy and delightful about streaking a plate, incubating it and coming back the next and being wowed (or not!), by the lovely and amazing colours, colony morphologies and aromas!  Call me a microbiology nerd if you like, but whatever it is, the ‘romantic’ notion of a traditional, culture-based microbiology diagnostic method still holds a lot of appeal.  It probably does for a lot of people as well, if Instagram is anything to go by.  It even holds appeal for people that have grown up in the era of routine molecular biology.  Take a look at our recent Instagram posts for example (@foodmicrobiologyacademy) where these culture media plates from books or the scientific/medical literature are well-liked by people in their early 20s.  That is so great to see, that the traditional and classical methods of microbiology are liked by today’s youthful microbiologists.So, if you like these beautiful colours of our microbiological world, check us out on Instagram!

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality",Raw milk quality survey,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/raw-milk-quality-survey/,"March 22, 2022","In 2005, I carried out a survey in a specific area of Victoria, of the microbiological quality of raw milk at different points in the pro-processing supply chain, both pre- and post-farmgate.  This is my report, outlining the mythology and results.Milk collection and transportMilk was collected from five sampling locations on 9 August 2005.  The locations comprised three farms (Farm A, Farm B, Farm C), the tanker which collected milk from those three farms on that day and silo 1 and the milk processing plant.  From each of the farms, samples were collected aseptically from the bulk tank into sterile, precooled (to approximately 0 ºC) sample jars.  Milk from the tanker (through the hatch on top of the tanker) or from the silo (through the door near the base of the silo) were also collected into sterile precooled (to approximately 0 ºC) sample jars.  The milk samples were kept in ice/water at approximately 0 ºC until the samples arrived at the laboratory in Melbourne, up to 18 h later.  Once the samples were at the laboratory facility, they were kept at approximately 0 ºC until analysis or further use, which was within 3h.Storage simulationTo simulate some possible storage scenarios that the raw milk could be exposed to, milk from each farm and the silo was stored at 4 ºC and 10 ºC for up to 7d.AnalysisUpon receipt in the laboratory, enumeration to determine the total plate count (on Plate Count Agar with an incubation period of 72 h at 30 ºC) and the psychrotrophicPseudomonascount (on Pseudomonas Agar Base plus C-F-C supplement with an incubation period of 240 h at 7 ºC) was carried out.  Enumeration by these methods were performed daily, as was pH measurement.  A portion of the milk from each day’s sampling was stored in an ultracold freezer, to be analysed later for lipase (triolein assay) and protease (FITC-casein assay) as well as free fatty acids (extraction/titration method and GC) and free amino groups (fluorescamine assay and CE).Presumptive identificationRepresentatives from each colony type growing on Pseudomonas Agar Base plus C-F-C supplement were selected for further investigation.  Initially this involved purification of the culture on non-selective media followed by Gram staining and testing for the presence of oxidase.  Those pure isolates which were oxidase positive Gram negative rods were presumptively identified as psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp., as they had been isolated from a plate selective forPseudomonasspp.Screening for lipase and proteaseAn agar diffusion method was used to screen the isolates for lipase and/or protease production.  Nutrient Agar plates containing either 0.1% triolein (for lipase) or 1% low-fat milk (for protease) were used.  The agar was poured in layers.  From the first layer, portions of the agar were removed using a 6 mm sterile cork borer.  To each well, a 10 μL volume of a 25 ºC-grown Nutrient Broth culture containing 108cfu/mL were added.  The plates were incubated for 168 h at 4 ºC with observations recorded after 93 h, as well as at the end of the incubation period.  The diameter of the zones were measured and recorded, as were the number of zones.ResultsColony counts on collected milkBoth total and psychrotrophic plate counts were low across all farms.  However, there were differences between the locations and especially between the farms.  Farm 1 (on every second day collection) had a comparatively low total count, at 2.5 x 103cfu/mL, particularly when compared with Farm 3 (on daily collection) which had a total plate count approximately ¾ of a log higher (Table 1).Table 1: Colony counts on raw milk on day of collection.Farm 12.5 x 103cfu/mL6.2 x 101cfu/mL (2.5% of total)Farm 27.0 x 102cfu/mL9.8 x 101cfu/mL (14.0% of total)Farm 39.0 x 103cfu/mL1.2 x 103cfu/mL (13.4% of total)Tanker5.0 x 103cfu/mL1.5 x 103cfu/mL (30.0% of total)Silo (#1)4.0 x 103cfu/mL2.0 x 103cfu/mL (50.0% of total)Colimn 1: Source of milk. Column 2: Total plate count. Column 3: PsychrotrophicPseudomonasplate countThe proportion of psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. in this total count was widely variable.  On Farm 1, these organisms comprised just 2.5% of the flora compared to the silo, where half of the microbes encountered were psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. (Table 1).Growth of milk microflora during storageClear differences were observed between the storage temperatures with the microflora in the milk stored at 10 ºC reaching stationary phase, sometime shortly after 48 h compared to the 4 ºC stored milk, where the microflora entered stationary phase after approximately 120 h of storage (Figure 1).  The growth curve from the 4 ºC stored milk showed a typical lag phase (0-2d), exponential phase (3-5d) and stationary phase (5-7 d).  Differences in the composition of the microflora were apparent because rates of growth varied.  The total count from Farm 2 was the lowest of all samples at the commencement of the incubation period.  However, after 72 h of incubation, it increased above the level of Farm 1, which started with a total count approximately half a log higher.The psychrotrophicPseudomonascounts were quite low at the start of incubation for some locations, but generally increased to a level where the growth curves were similar to the total counts (Figure 2).  As is known, pseudomonads often didn’t display a prominent lag phase.  The Farm 2 psychrotrophicPseudomonascount results in fact, looked to be in exponential phase from 0-5d.Figure 1:Figure 2:","dairy farm, dairy products, dairy technology, food microbiology, food preservation, food science, food spoilage, microbiology, milk, raw milk"
Bacteria,bacteria,Listeriosis and eggs,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/listeriosis-and-eggs/,"March 17, 2022","This is an extract of a report by a 3rd-year food science student, Jiahui Tan, at RMIT University in 2008.  While salmonellae andCampylobacterspecies, mainlyC. jejuni, are more often thought of as poultry- product-borne pathogens, due to the ubiquitous occurrence of literiae, especiallyL. monocytogenes, listeriosis can be an egg-borne disease.Listeria is aGram-positive, non-spore forming rod with a total of six species recognized. However, onlyListeria monocytogenesis an important human pathogen. (Adams & Moss, 2006) Other species of this genus includesL. ivanovii, L. murrayi, L. innocua, L.seeligeri and L. gravi.(Jay et. al., 2005)L. innocuahas also been frequently used as a biological indicator forL. monocytogenesbecause of its similar response to physical, chemical or thermal treatments. (Kamat & Nair, 1996)According to Adams & Moss (2006),L. monocytogenesis ubiquitous in the environment and grows over a large range of temperature from 0 to 42oC with an optimum between 30 and 35oC. Swaminathan & Gerner-Smidt (2007) also describedL . monocytogenesas a foodborne pathogen that is resistant to acid and capable of growing at low temperature. This means that it may grow in refrigerated food which poses a risk to food that are originally stored in chilled temperature to extend shelf life. The ability to grow over a wide temperature range, in the acidic environment, as well as in the absence or in very low amounts of O2, suggest thatL. monocytogenesis able to multiply in many environment which is potentially dangerous in the processing of food. (Gómez et. al., 2005)It is well established thatListeriaare widely distributed in nature and any fresh product may harbourL. monocytogenes. (Jay et. al., 2005) These range from raw milk (Carlos et. al, 2001), soft cheeses (Guerra et. al, 2001), fish (Farber, 1991), meat products (Grau & Vanderline, 1992), poultry (Vitas & Garcia-Jalon, 2004), raw eggs (Leasor & Foegeding, 1989; Brackett & Beuchat, 1991), vegetables (Koseki & Isobe, 2005) and ready-to-eat-food (Vitas & Garcia-Jalon, 2004). For the association of cheeses, Adams & Moss (2006) mentioned that the survival ofL. monocytogenesis due to the ripening process. It was reported that this pathogen survives poorly in unripened soft cheeses such as cottage cheese, but well in products such as Camembert and Brie.In spite of high incidence ofL. monocytogenesin poultry, little information is available on incidence in raw egg. (Laird et. al., 1991) Although there was no documented cases of  clinical illness cause byL. monocytogenesfor the consumption of egg or egg products, findings suggest that a possible public health problem could develop. (Moore & Madden, 1992). Calderon-Miranda et. al., (1999) suggest that an increase in handling during manufacturer of breaking of shell eggs and adjusting of solid content may enhance the growth and survival ofL. monocytogenes.L. monocytogeneshas been implicated as the causative agent of both epidemic and sporadic foodborne illness known as listeriosis. (Carlos et. al., 2001). The symptoms in human are not well defined as there are a unique set of symptoms for the disease depending on the state of host. (Jay et. al., 2005) A range of clinical conditions for the disease can vary from mild, flu-like illness (Adams & Moss, 2006) to manifestation; including septicaemia and meningitis (Vitas et. al., 2004).Jay et. al. (2005) mentioned that the infectious dose for listeriosis is not well established but may be low in susceptible individuals. According to Adam & Moss (2006), the prevalence ofL. monocytogenesisolated from samples are found to be as low as 102cfu/g. The first outbreak of listeriosis by food occurred in the Maritime Provinces of Canada in 1981. (Adams & Moss, 1996). It involved 41 cases in all with 28.6% mortality rate in adult cases.  Rouquete & Berche (1996) reports similar data with an approximate 20% mortality with an increase of up to 75% in high risk groups such as pregnant women, neonates, and immunocompromised adults. Forum data obtained from Swaminathan & Gerner-Smidt (2007) reported that the death rate was 44% for an outbreak due to coleslaw in 1981 at Nova Scotia, Canada. These evidence demonstrated that listeriosis is a serious disease and has a very high mortality rate. NNDSS (2008) reported an increase of listeriosis from 1994, with 35 cases, to 2006 with 61 cases for Australia, of which Victoria reported the second highest occurrence of 13 cases. The rise is almost a 75% increase over that period and hence the probably of occurrence and severity indicates a high risk of listeriosis.Naghmouchiet. al. (2007) also mentioned that this organism is ranked first among food-borne pathogenic bacteria in terms of death rate, far ahead ofCampylobacter, SalmonellaandEscherichia coliO157:H7. Therefore, measures to prevent of this foodborne pathogen in the future is important for a production of safe foods for the consumer, as its low presence can cause a huge impact to the individual’s health.ReferencesAdams, M.

Bacteria,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Prospective probiotic food alternatives,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prospective-probiotic-food-alternatives/,"March 12, 2022","Probiotics, digestive health and the gut microbiota are absolutely essential to health and wellness.  They really are cornerstones to maintaining a steady state of physical and mental health.  While this aspect may not always have been known, the benefits of fermented foods in general has been long known.  It’s always important to point out the distinction between probiotic foods and fermented foods.  A food can be probiotic, but not fermented food.  This would be when probiotics are added.  On the other hand, we can have a fermented food that is not (naturally) probiotic.  An example is kombucha.  Of course there are some foods which are fermented and probiotic, where they microorganisms that engage in the fermentation process, also provide health benefits to the host.  Foods for delivery of probiotics is so, so important.  This of course changes from country to country, and region to region, depending on the local palate and seasonality, for example.  This piece on the types of probiotic foods, as alternatives to the traditional probiotic foods of yogurt and kimchi for example, was written by Amy Tsang in 2008, a 3rd-year food science student at RMIT University.  While it is not an up-to-date account of probiotic food innovations, the ideas may stimulate thinking for your own new probiotic food development project.It is quite challenging to develop palatable and socially acceptable probiotic products for consumption, especially for non-dairy probiotic foods due to the bacteria’s sensitive character towards processing methods. Successfully manufacturing non dairy probiotics can be highly reliant upon the food matrix, these factors can consist of; pH level, storage temperature, oxygen levels and presence of competing organisms and inhibitors (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002). As cited in (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002) a method to overcome probiotic instability in non-dairy probiotics, is to introduce a method referred to as probiotic encapsulation technology. This method although successful in promoting stability of probiotic bacteria in non-dairy products; it was not utilized in any of the research papers analysed below, however the method was mentioned by (Yoon et. al, 2006).Probiotic products should be made available to suit all diets; vegetarians and consumers who suffer from diseases and allergies. As cited in (Heenan et. al, 2004) “probiotics are usually marketed in the form of fermented milks and yoghurts; however, with an increase in consumer vegetarianism throughout the country, there is a demand for vegetarian probiotic products.”The criteria for vegetarian probiotic products is simple, no animal-derived ingredients are to be used in the production process. According to (Heenan, et. al, 2004) this also applies to the media used to culture the probiotic organisms, and any ingredients used for preservation or storage. A study conducted by (Heenan, et. al, 2004) looked into a non- fermented vegetarian frozen soy dessert, and analysed the survival of probiotic organisms and sensory differences over a 6 month period. The study found that many of the probiotic bacteria such asLactobacillus acidophilus,L. rhamnosisandBifidobacterium lactissurvived the frozen conditions quite well and the numbers of viable cells were still above the minimum requirement of 107cfu/g. As for the sensory attributes, the soy- based dessert containingL. acidophilusdeveloped off-flavours (Heenan et. al, 2004).Another example of a non-dairy probiotic product is the development of a new oat-based probiotic drink, in this study (Angelov et. al, 2006) have attempted to develop a symbiotic drink derived from whole grain oat substrate and probiotic starter culture. This drink combines a good source of beta-glucan (functional constituent of cereal fibers) with probiotic cultures (Angelov et. al, 2006), because oats have a low glycemic index, this drink may be beneficial to patients who suffer from diabetes.Another probiotic alternative was under evaluation;B. brevestrain Yakult in fermented soymilk, this study focused on the capability ofB. brevestrain Yakult to grow in fermented soymilk and investigated the vivo recovery of the administered strain from faeces (Shimakawa et. al, 2003). The results for this investigation revealed that theB. brevestrain Yakult was present in high numbers after consumption; through faecal recovery. It was stated that:” the fermented soy-milk would be an excellent vehicle for live Bifidobacterium” (Shimakawa et. al, 2003, discussion section).Red beets were also analysed as a substrate for the creation of beet juice by four species of lactic acid bacteria;Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus plantarum(Yoon et. al, 2005). The results concluded that large beets could be used to produce beet juice by lactic acid fermentation withL. acidophilusorL. plantarum(Yoon, et. al, 2005). In addition to beet juice, cabbage juice was also investigated; the completed results concluded thatL. plantarumandL. delbrueckiicould be used as probiotic cultures, furthermore emphasise was placed cabbage juice as a healthy alternative for vegetarians and consumers who were allergic to lactose present in dairy products (Yoon, et. al, 2006).ReferencesAngelov, A., Gotcheva, V., Kuncheva, R., Hristozova, T., 2006, ‘Development of a new oat-based probiotic drink,’International Journal of Food Microbiology,vol. 112, pp.75-80.Heenan., C.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality, food-spoilage",The future of practical food microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-future-of-practical-food-microbiology/,"January 29, 2022","How we work within food microbiology – important topics … and the techniques and conceptual approaches that make it happen.Molecular methodologies dominate practical aspects of modern biology – food, environmental and agricultural microbiology is no exception.  However, it is more important for analytical methodologies in these areas of microbiology to focus on accuracy and precision rather than speed.  In other areas of food microbiology, such as food safety investigations during disease outbreaks, where rapid results are especially important, rapid and sometimes real-time methods are vital.  However, speed is relatively unimportant when detecting and identifying microorganisms in the context of food fermentations, environmental microbiology studies and agricultural microbiology.  Thus, time to result is relatively unimportant, whereas getting as close as possible to the correct result is paramount, even if the “correct result” is an unknown bacterial species.  Sometimes, obtaining any result may not be possible at all, which is one of the challenges.Unlike other areas of microbiology, like food safety outbreak investigations, many a time, work in these areas has more of a focus on investigation and detection of non-standard or rare microorganisms.  Such investigations could very well involve novel microorganisms, completely new to science.  Therefore, by and large, a different approach is required, compared to those fields of microbiology which routinely involve investigation of typical, known and expected microorganisms.  The idea ‘you find what you look for’ is so true in these particular microbiology analyses, where, in the case of environmental samples, very few microorganisms may be culturable, despite being metabolically active.  Consequently, what doesn’t work that well in environmental microbiology investigations are comparison of results to known databases or using known PCR primers.  As a result, investigative protocols based on 16s rRNA tend to work best (Benllochet al., 1995).  There will still be some limitations if a PCR methodology is employed, but independent testing regimes exist (Rosselliet al., 2016), which therefore do away with the limitation of the use of primers to known gene sequences.Molecular and spectroscopic approaches to analytical microbiologyPrior to the era of routine molecular biology, traditional cultural and biochemical methods, relying on genetic differences manifesting as observable phenotypic differences, were the mainstay of bacterial detection and identification, in food microbiology and indeed other areas of microbiology.  However, since 1995 when the first bacterial genome was sequenced, molecular genetics, in particular of whole genomes, has moved into the area of semi-routine.  Previously limited by technical capabilities, the shortcomings of combining numerous short DNA sequences were largely overcome, at least in a practical sense in certain applications by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).  However, this has been rapidly superseded by whole genome sequencing (WGS), used increasingly for routine foodborne disease outbreak investigations of an epidemiological nature.  This allows for unprecedented levels of precision in strain distinction and hence for determining relatedness, allowing for previously unmatched levels of understanding in the development and movement of bacterial pathogens.Workflow of whole genome sequencing in a laboratory.In addition, the interface of biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics as a combination in various areas of applied microbiology, allows for the development of practical approaches to solving real-world problems in food microbiology that have never been possible.  For example, while the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) isn’t new in the context of food quality analysis, it is now being refined and extended into a new level of precision for pathogenic bacterial detection in food products.  This, and other approaches, such as electrochemical-based sensor technology for detection of spoilage bacteria within food products offers quick and precise analysis that isn’t invasive.  Overall, the field of molecular microbiology is more prominent than ever, with various omics techniques, in particular genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, becoming an increasing indispensable part of modern microbiology.  As in all areas of biology, going (or gone!) are the days of purely phenotypic characterisation as being sufficient.  Today demands a greater understanding, to levels never before seen, as we delve deep into cell biology and genetics, unlocking secrets with increasing capabilities due to contributions from diverse fields of chemistry, physics and mathematics, that combine, to propel analytical microbiology to a whole new era in the coming years.https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0039914016308281-fx1.jpgReal-time on-site near infrared spectroscopy analysis.Progress on approaches to grow microorganisms that cannot be grown as yet,The topic of this section can be related to either those bacterial cells that have never been cultured, and it is understood that an estimated 99% of all species of Archaea and Bacteria are yet to be cultured, or in the so-called viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state, a concept developed some 40 years ago by Xuet al.(1982) to describe the survival mechanism state where normally culturable bacterial cells that are metabolically active, enter into a state of being unable to be cultured.  This would essentially result in false negative readings in microbiologically food analysis, where the metabolically active bacterial cells are in fact present, but although unable to grow and form colonies on artificial media, may certainly still be virulent and remain in a state of pathogenicity.  Thus, Fakruddinet al.(2013) states that negative microbiological test results from food products cannot necessarily be considered from pathogens.  A key feature of the preceding section is the fact that molecular level and omics techniques are contributing to bring forth elements of discovery previously unheard of, and thus enabling their incorporation into routine commercial, industrial  and/or diagnostic practice.  This too, is a key feature here, where DNA analysis techniques are likely to offer improved opportunities for exploring the largely unexplored microbial world in the context of food microbiology.  This could very well provide some breakthrough moments in industrial and/or public health challenges and furthermore, may offer new opportunities to be developed, in potentially unknown ways, from the identification, genome sequence of and industrial/research use of potentially undiscovered microorganisms.  A practical consideration is how to survey and collect microorganisms from a whole range of extreme environments on our planet.  There were great limitations on advancements in this field prior to the widespread availability of molecular analysis tools.  Despite the benefits of a molecular-based approach, Rampelotto (2013) states that the modern techniques of molecular biology, when used in combination with traditional cultural methods, will deliver the best approach.https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/237514/fmicb-08-00580-HTML/image_m/fmicb-08-00580-g001.jpgDevelopment of the viable but nonculturable state in bacterial food borne

Bacteriophage, or phage for short, are viruses of bacteria, meaning that bacteriophage therapy is a biological control concept, and is a natural approach to combat bacteria.  As phage, like all viruses, are non-living entities, meaning they don’t fulfil the criteria for life, they are dependent on bacteria for their survival.  Therefore, no (bacterial) host cells, no phage.  Thus, it is impossible for them to proliferate out of control.  While bacteriophage therapy for human infectious disease dates back around a hundred years at its peak, a newer concept is phage-based biocontrol of foodborne pathogens and bacterial spoilage microorganisms.  This would tick all the boxes for a safe and effective, natural approach to handle the public and economic burden of foodborne disease, plus the economic losses associated with the growth of spoilage bacteria.

Bacteria,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, public-health",Part 2 of antibiotic resistance,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/part-2-of-antibiotic-resistance/,"December 3, 2021","Antibiotic resistance is a significant global challenge, fast becoming one of this century’s most significant issues.  Not only does it have concerns in human and veterinary medicine, in agriculture and food science, but in public health too.  We must act now to stem the tide, the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, before it becomes an insurmountable obstacle and drives the demise of humanity, of civilisation.Let us launch straight into the concerns of antibiotic use for our own personal health…Another important problem is associated with our own microbiome, primarily our gut microbiome, since many antibiotics are taken orally.  Unfortunately, a substantial number of antibiotics are prescribed rapidly and without reference to any antimicrobial sensitivity testing.  Under such circumstances, patients almost demand an antibiotic prescription after visiting a clinician.  The medico, under this kind of pressure from their patient, doesn’t have the time to wait up to 48 hours (or longer) for an antimicrobial sensitivity test result, typically doesn’t even request a sample, rather, prescribes a broad spectrum antibiotic, often based on nothing more than clinical observation and possible symptom history, which may be sometimes unreliable.  While this is a quick and easy way to satisfy a patient, it is harmful in multiple ways.  For example, indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics will contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes during active infections and among human and environmental reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria.  Furthermore, the patient will be unaware that taking a broad spectrum antibiotic may or may not eliminate the bacteria troubling them, but even if it does, it is highly likely to do untold damage to the host’s own flora, their microbial ecosystem.  This could open the patient up to side effects or additional infections, once the protection, primarily from the gut microbiota is severely disrupted.  Severely disrupted to the stage where opportunistic pathogenic bacteria could gain a ‘foothold’, resulting in an additional and subsequent infection(s).  So, indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics is certainly highly likely to do more harm (in the longer term) than good (n the shorter term).The way microorganisms can potentially address this, while largely unknown, would surely lie within the immense unknown prokaryotic diversity that remains to be discovered.  A few years ago,Locey and Lennon (2016)provided an updated estimation of the total prokaryotic species on our planet, which they said, is likely to be in excess of one trillion.  We currently are aware of an absolute minuscule proportion of this estimated total.  Therefore, simply by intensifying research investigations of extreme environments for yet-to-be discovered microbes and developing means to actually culture them, is likely to hold a key to humanity’s success.  Just through a trial and error investigation of the microbial world, we are highly likely to unlock some prokaryotic secrets that could hold value in addressing our global challenges.  Really, it could very well be a numbers game – with so many undiscovered species and undiscovered potential, the answers are likely to be there, if we look long and hard enough.  An important element of this though is keeping an open mind.  Keeping an open mind with regard to what we are looking for, where we look for it, how we look for it, how they are cultured and more.  If we don’t, we could very well miss the opportunity of a lifetime to change the course of humanity.  It takes sharpness, alertness and looking at situations from a different perspective to be able to recognise potential.  IfAlexander Fleming hadn’t noticed on 28 September 1928that a contaminating mould was inhibiting the growth of an important human pathogenic bacterium, the world would be a different place today.  He could have easily seen the contaminating mould on that agar plate, thrown it away, and an opportunity to change the course of humanity would have been lost.Scouring the unexplored microbial world for compounds of potential use which can be used to address human challenges is one aspect, and a key area where global efforts should be directed.  However, as old as fermented foods and probiotics are, they hold much potential to further address issues of public health associated with diet, which really, is the cornerstone to good health of everyone.  Even though each of us contain untold diversity in our own microbiome, it is still not well understood.  Innovative analytical methods are needed to improve characterisation of the human microbiome.  Furthermore, the way it is linked to a range of elements and indicators of health needs to be elucidated.  This could result in targeted food product development activities and direct public health messages, based on sound science, around what will be beneficial for health within the context of today’s lifestyle.  Furthermore, fermented foods are trending and this trend and positive image by consumers should be explored further to produce diverse fermented foods that are able to bring great public health benefits while satisfying people’s increasing desire for exotic tastes with new foods.  There are countless microorganisms of fermentative potential, and numerous types of food substrates that could be used to develop a wide range of natural and healthy foods. Consumers’ positivity towards fermented foods and beverages should really be explored further to bring them products likely to gain rapid market acceptance.  The idea is that with improved public health from improved personal health resulting from healthier eating of diverse food products of microbial origin, there would be less reliance on antibiotics.","agriculture, antibiotic resistance, food microbiology, human medicine, microbiology, probiotics, veterinary medicine"
Bacteria,"bacteria, public-health",Part 1 of antibiotic resistance,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/part-1-of-antibiotic-resistance/,"November 3, 2021","An introduction to the relationship between microbiology and the big global issues of our time.  Microorganisms are indispensable to the human existence.  Although less in the spotlight, the beneficial effects of microorganisms for various aspects of human endeavour cannot be underestimated.  Life as we know it would not be sustainable without the contributions of a myriad of microorganisms.  From the global diversity of fermented foods produced by microorganisms to the probiotics that contribute to ensuring a stable gut microbiome for a range of personal health benefits, from gut health to mental health, microorganisms are the cornerstone of humanity’s success.  Furthermore, there are indirect benefits to our food supply, through the positive contributions microorganisms make to agriculture, from livestock probiotics to regenerating soil and reducing crop reliance on traditional pesticides, the array of benefits and their significance is staggering.  As a global society exploring options to address the significant challenges of our time, the importance of microbial contributions to human activities is likely to increase.  As crises associated with climate, environmental damage, population growth, infectious disease outbreaks, food insecurity and more increase in prominence, the world is likely to turn microbial-associated solutions.  From supply of nutritious foods and combating infectious diseases to bioremediation and regeneration of agricultural land, microorganisms have demonstrated their wide-ranging potential.  Thus, the key to longevity of humanity on this planet, and maybe even colonisation of other planets, could very well lie with unlocking the secrets of known, and yet to be discovered microorganisms.  There is an immense amount we are unaware of, in the microbial world, in fact, we may even be ignorant to what we don’t know.  Consequently, microbiology stands at the edge of an very exciting period, with food microbiology in particular, being on the verge of contributing much to enable humanity to overcome some of the greatest challenges ever faced – we just need to further tap into the richness of the microbial world and harness it’s treasures in a way that brings harmony to the biosphere.If we first look at antibiotics – there’s no doubt over the significance for humanity of antibiotics.  The chance discovery in 1928 (Fleming, 1929), and the subsequent trials and commercialisation that led to penicillin use during the first world war no doubt started a revolution in public health.  No longer were many bacterial infectious diseases to be feared to the extent they once were.  Penicillin changed the course of medicine (Gaynes, 2017) and there’s no doubt that the world was never the same during this antibiotic era compared with before.  Reductions in illness and death along with increases in longevity have changed the face of society as antibiotic use became routinely available across the globe.  As with many tools, when they are used for their intended use, little harm occurs and any risk or hazards can be more easily managed.  Antibiotics are meant to either stop the growth of invading pathogenic bacteria, thus giving the host’s immune system a better chance to combat the infection or go one step further and actually eliminate the invading pathogenic bacteria, on behalf of the host’s immune system.  Antibiotics should not be used routinely and/or regularly (except in rare and exceptional circumstances) and definitely should not be used in a preventative capacity.  It is therefore important to remember some key points; I) Antibiotics are part of natural microbial defence mechanisms, II) Antibiotics can act as broad-spectrum (effective against a wide range of bacterial species) or narrow-spectrum (effective against a limited range of bacterial species), III) Bacteria have short generation times and therefore can undergo rapid mutation, IV) Gene transfer between bacterial species to facilitate the dominance of beneficial phenotypes can occur frequently.Overzealous prescription of antibiotics, in combination with the demanding attitude of some patients and those patients that don’t follow antibiotics’ instructions for use, certainly contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance and damage to the human microbiome.  However, it is excessive veterinary use, or misuse, of antibiotics in agriculture, which is potentially more cause for concern.  Legitimate use of antibiotics for control of active infections, as is the case with humans, is one thing, but when antibiotics are used to prevent infections in livestock and then for other growth promoting purposes in animal-based agricultural systems, then that is bad news.  Antibiotics were never designed for routine prevention use, and should never be used in this way.  Why is this?  When there’s an environment where antibiotics are constantly present, that becomes the norm.  This will select for bacteria that are able to grow better under such conditions, meaning the constant presence of antibiotics will select for antibiotic resistant bacteria – that’s just the way nature works.  Antibiotic resistant bacteria, or better put, bacteria containing genes, either on their chromosome or more typically plasmid-borne, for antibiotic resistance are clearly going to be at an advantage over those bacteria that don’t have such genes.  It is worth reiterating that antibiotic resistant genes are always present, but under normal circumstances, without the (constant) presence of antibiotics, bacteria which have such genes are at no selective growth advantage over those bacteria that don’t have such genes.  Therefore, such bacteria remain at a consistently low proportion.  With increasing exposure to antibiotics, the bacteria that do not have antibiotic resistance genes will be less competitive in such an environment and start to die off at a greater level, reducing in proportion as the selection pressure favours those bacteria with antibiotic resistance genes.  As exposure to antibiotics continues, the scale tips more and more in favour of bacteria that possess antibiotic resistance genes, which increase in proportion in that population.https://www.reactgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/190318-Natural-selection-ReAct.pngReferencesFleming, A., 1929.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-safety, public-health",Genetic control of the bacterial adaptive acid tolerance response.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/genetic-control-of-the-bacterial-adaptive-acid-tolerance-response/,"September 1, 2021","In 1998 and 1999, at what is now the Mount Helen campus of Federation University in Ballarat, Victoria, I completed my Honours degree in food science, submitting my thesis on 16 July 1999 and graduating in May the following year.  My thesis was in the area of bacterial physiology, specifically on the adaptive acid tolerance response in two key food borne disease bacteria – the Gram negativeEscherichia coliand the Gram positiveStaphylococcus aureus.  Many physiological mechanisms may contribute to this acid tolerance response, which has much significance in food manufacturing and indeed the virulence of these bacteria, which ultimately, makes this physiological phenomenon of public health significance too.  An increased acid tolerant state may offer enhanced survival in low pH foods and aid subsequent gastric passage, enabling proliferation further along the gastrointestinal tract.  Thus, the adaptive acid tolerance response is considered a virulence factor as it contributes to pathogenesis.  In this blog article, I want to cover just two of the (genetic) bases for an adaptation to extremes and normally lethal pH values.  Please note though that my thesis was submitted in July of 1999, and therefore this piece of writing covers the knowledge in this area up to that date only.4.7.2 GenesA number of genes have been identified which directly or indirectly assist bacteria in their attempt to survive low pH conditions.  With S. typhimurium, at least 17 genes have been identified(Foster, 1995).  These are reviewed byFoster (1995).  Of these, two genes,rpoSandfurwill be discussed further.Some genes, present in a variety of bacterial species, are widely accepted as regulators of inducible acid tolerance, such asrpoSand probablyfur.  However, some specific genes may play an essential role in the inducible acid tolerance of certain bacteria, for example,actAinRhizobium meliloti(Tiwari et. al., 1996).4.7.2.1rpoSgeneTherpoSgene is a member of a group of genes that enable survival under a range of extreme conditions.  A related gene, also widely researched (Huang et. al., 1998;Emetz and Klug, 1998), isrpoH, required for the heat shock response ofE. coli.Cheville et al. (1995)have demonstrated the vital nature ofrpoSin a variety of acidic conditions, including fermented meat, and in addition, found that the stationary phase RpoS protein gave tolerance to heat and salt.Salmonellahave also been shown (through gene cloning experiments) to requirerpoSto tolerate acid(Lee et. al., 1995)while similar observations have been made withBacillus subtilis(Hecker and Volker, 1998).  More importantly, the alternative sigma factor encoded byrpoSand the subsequent acid shock proteins, such as RpoS, induced a sustained ATR rather than just a transient induced tolerance to acid(Lee et. al., 1995).  They have shown that induction of the transient ATR can occur without RpoS but for the cells to survive beyond 20min in low pH, RpoS is required.  The central role played by therpoSgene has been clearly demonstrated in a number of species by the construction of mutants lacking this gene.  These species includeS. flexneri(Waterman and Small, 1996)andS.Typhimurium(Wilmes-Risenberg et. al., 1997).  As well as enabling survival in extreme heat, salt and acid, alternate sigma factors (in this situation, alternate sigma factor 54) can also function in times of nitrogen deprivation of the cell via the generpoN, as described byLewin (1994).  While these groups of genes are responsible for enabling survival in a variety of stress responses, rpoS itself can provide general stress protection against diverse environmental conditions.  For example, inPseudomonas aeruginosa,rpoSincreases resistance up to three-fold against heat, low pH, high osmolarity, hydrogen peroxide and ethanol(Jorgensen et. al., 1999).4.7.2.2 fur geneResponsible for iron uptake, thefur(ferric uptake regulator) gene has been shown byLee et. al. (1995)to be necessary for a transient ATR inS.Typhimurium whileFoster and Hall (1992)describe the contribution of the Fur protein to expression of fur as “extensive”.Bagg and Neilands (1987)describe the action of Fur and state that the most obvious means of action is that transcription offuris repressed by Fur binding to Fe, which reversibly attaches to the operator sequence.  Perhaps unexpectedly, the ATR function of Fur is not induced by iron with both systems (iron acquisition and ATR) acting independently of each other(Hall and Foster, 1996).S.Typhimuriumfurmutans demonstrate the importance of this gene as shown by the work ofFoster (1993)who has shown that afurmutant was unable to induce pre- or post-shock acid adaptation and also byWilmes-Riesenberg et. al. (1996)who found that this mutant had reduced virulence as the LD50 (in mice) was higher, up to a 3-log increase.  Although not a direct mutation infur,Foster and Bearson (1994)have shown thatS.Typhimurium mutants with mutations inatrDandatrF(these mutations affect iron metabolism and regulation) are acid-sensitive.  They state that this supports the idea of the involvement of Fur-regulated genes in inducible acid tolerance.",
Bacteria,"bacteria, food-safety",Sous vide and food safety,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/sous-vide-and-food-safety/,"August 25, 2021","One of our two recently commenced student interns is Gaurav Joshi.  Gaurav is a senior professional chef, making a career change to food science.  He’s currently studying at RMIT University in Melbourne.  Combining his interests and backgrounds in professional cooking and food safety, Gaurav suggested a blog article on the food safety aspects of Sous Vide cooking … and here it is!Unlike food manufacturing, where strict time and temperature combinations are rigorously observed, the realm of hospitality and domestic cooking abounds with questionable preparation methods, from a food safety context.  While thermal processing or non-thermal processing of equivalent severity must be employed the world over, regardless of jurisdiction (although I’m sure there are obscure exceptions!), uncooked food (i.e. raw!) is permitted in the hospitality industry.  Why is the strict adherence to microbial food safety in food manufacturing not observed in hospitality?  That’s the topic for another blog article, for sure.  However, one point is for sure, you can rely on the microbial food safety of industrially manufactured food – but not so with food in the hospitality scene.  No matter what people say or how much they try and convince you, food that is not prepared to government-stated food safety conditions is not safe.  There’s no such thing as “cooking” food with lemon juice for example, as is done with ceviche.  Yes, true, the low pH of the lemon juice will denature the fish proteins, giving it the appearance of being “cooked”, as it has physically changed appearance, but don’t be fooled – the fish is still unsafe to eat as it is raw, it hasn’t actually been cooked yet.So how about cooking techniques that use moderate heat?  One of those is sous vide, which uses temperatures which hover just below and a little above the temperature danger zone.  Does that make it risky from a food safety perspective?  It sure does.  The temperature danger zone is between 5 °C – 60 °C, which means to be safe, food must be kept for extended periods below 5 °C or above 60 °C.  Extended periods means beyond four hours, because once food has been in the temperature danger zone for a total of four hours (not just four consecutive hours, but four hours in total), it is considered unsafe and must be discarded.  When one considers that cooking some meat rare by sous vide has food sitting in the temperature danger zone for up to 72 hours, once starts to see just how risky and unsafe sous vide is!While different bacteria are inactivated at different rates at different temperatures, there’s a general consensus, as echoed by the recommendations of public health authorities, that temperatures over 70 °C are required for safe cooking of food.  That would be the basis for the temperature danger zone ending at 60 °C, then there’s a margin of safety, then approximately 70 °C and above is a safe cooking temperature.  Therefore, when you have food cooking for any period of time in the temperature danger, let alone several, there’s no doubt the element of risk is increased.  Clearly, this is an element of risk that doesn’t need to be introduced.Let us look at it closer … the D value, which in thermal inactivation is the decimal reduction time, is the time at a certain temperature where one log (90%) of microorganisms is eliminated.  In the table extract below, Li and Gänzle (2016) reviewed heat resistance studies ofEscherichia coli, and show that between 55 °C and 58 °C degrees, the D value is around 12 to 15 minutes.  This means that under a worst case scenario of a heavy bacterial load of contaminatingE. coli, it would take nearly 1½hours to reduce the cells to a negligible amount.  With small (2½cm) tender cuts of beef being cooked for just an hour at 57 °C, there’s certainly an element of risk there.  With fish, the situation is even more concerning with, a temperature of just 52 °C used and a cooking time of only 20 to 30 minutes.Furthermore, with lengthy periods at sub-lethal temperatures, any heat resistant mutants will be selected for, as would thermoduric microorganisms.  Both of these will begin to dominate, ultimately proliferating in the cooking food, while the home cook is blissfully unaware of what is happening.What can be done and should we keep eating a food that has potentially to be microbial unsafe?  It is certainly best to avoid such food and cooking methods for meat as it is just not worth it.  This is especially the case if you are a home cook.  Chefs will know how to perfect the technique for exceptional food quality while ensuring a high level of food safety.  However, it is best not to experiment with this technique at home, due to the case at which food safety breaches can be made.  The New South Wales Food Authority in Australia (https://www.foodauthority.nsw.gov.au/consumer/food-at-home/cooking-sous-vide) have put together a guide on how to safely cook sous vide, but whatever the case, best to leave it to the professionals.prepare thinner portions of food so that heating and cooling are rapidkeep water bath temperatures at 55 °C or hotterlimit the time food is cooked at cooler than 55 °C to no more than 6 hoursuse quality equipment with adequate heating capacity and excellent temperature controlcheck water and/or food temperatures with an accurate, tip-sensitive digital thermometer accurate to 0.1 °Cstore prepared foods for no more than 5 daysdo not compound multiple risks, for example, if meat has been mechanically tenderised do not cook large portions for a long time at low temperatures.ReferenceLi H and Gänzle M (2016) Some Like It Hot: Heat Resistance ofEscherichia coliin Food.Front.

Bacteria,bacteria,Be aware of Listeria monocytogenes,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/be-aware-of-listeria-monocytogenes/,"August 10, 2021","Idea for this blog article:Arsha Pradhan, Student Intern(currently studying at the Asian Institute of Technology in Bangkok, Thailand).Text of this blog article written by:Philip Button, Academy Director and Head of ResearchWhile much emphasis, and rightly so, is given toCampylobacter jejuni,Salmonellaand viruses like Norovirus as the most common cause of bacterial and viral food borne disease, we mustn’t lose sight ofListeria monocytogenes, the causal agent of listeriosis which is the most severe type of foodborne disease.  Although the disease can present as a mild gastroenteritis (Riedeet al., 1994), it is often more than this with neurological sequelae not common, such as life-threatening meningoencephalitis described by Bülaet al.(1995).  The mortality rate in vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, can approach 75% while those immunocompromised or smoking have a 50% chance of survival (Thønningset al., 2016)  It can also cause disease in animals, such as the sheep infections described by Reuteret al.(1989) in Western Australia.  Other species ofListeria, apart fromL. monocytogenes, have been known to cause infections in humans and animals, but these are really quite rare.L. ivanoviiwould be one of these other pathogenicListeriaspecies (Hageet al., 2014).A wide variety of food products have been implicated in foodborne outbreaks, since this species is widespread in the natural environment.  Of more concern is thatL. monocytogeneshas often been found in food manufacturing plants (Khanet al., 2016).  In the natural environment, association with animals is common – Gray and Killinger (1966) note that 38 mammal species have been found to carryL. monocytogenes.In recent years, 2017 and 2018, there were two significant outbreaks that should serve as a reminder about the need for vigilance with regard toL. monocytogenes.  The world’s largestL. monocytogenesoutbreak took place across 2017 and 2018 in South Africa.  It was linked to processed meat products and ultimately resulted in 1 060 confirmed cases and 216 deaths (Tchatchouanget al., 2020).  In Australia, a significant outbreak traced to rockmelons from the Riverina region of New South Wales resulted in six deaths and 18 confirmed cases – 16 in Australia and two in Singapore.  Overall,L. monoytogenesis one of two key pathogens that is emerging as an important cause of foodborne disease through consumption of fresh produce (Wadamoriet al., 2017).Of great significance with regard to its control is the fact thatL. monocytogenesis psychrotropic.  This means that if it is present in/on a food, refrigeration of that food will not have a bacteriostatic effect, in fact, it will select for its growth.  The low temperatures will reduce competition in that food product, creating more favourable conditions for the growth ofL. monocytogenes, due to its psychrotrophy.  Furthermore, much work has demonstrated the existence of adaptive stress responses, not only to a single stress condition, such as acid (Daviset al., 1996), but that it possess a stress cross-protection system that can be initiated as a global response to different, separate stress conditions (Skandamiset al., 2008).  Results from our work have also shown this –Listeria monocytogenesexposed to physiological stressors of high salt (10% NaCl) or moderately low pH in organic acid (lactic acid at pH 5.5) showed improved survival in chicken meat when cooked under normal time and temperature conditions.  This really demonstrates and supports the vigilance that needs to be taken with this species, because it is very capable of survival and indeed growth under a range of conditions that normally are not tolerated by other species.Pregnant women are often the target of awareness campaigns regarding listeriosis, although in addition, Moranet al.(2018) points out that neonates, immunocompromised people and the elderly are particularly vulnerable, and some mortality statistic were presented earlier in this article around this.  However, with regard to pregnant women, this is because, in addition to gastroenteritis and a range of neurological conditions, infection byL. monocytogenesmay result in various pregnancy complications, including miscarriage in the first trimester.  Therefore, pregnant women are a key group that are reminded to reduce their risk by not consuming high-risk foods, such as soft cheeses.With its significance as a foodborne pathogen,L. monocytogenesrequires attention.  Through good hygiene and good cleaning, GAP, GMP, a HACCP plan and the practical steps that can be taken in the home to ensure cross contamination can all help.  However, remember, if it is on or in a food product you have, refrigerating that food will only make the food more hazardous from a listeriosis perspective.  Therefore, as a general rule of thumb, it is always advised to reduce the time that you have food stored, anywhere.  Minimise the length of time you store food in the refrigerator so as to not give psychrotropic microorganisms a chance to proliferate.ReferencesBüla, C. J., Bille, J., & Glauser, M. P. (1995).

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality",Psychrotrophs in food science,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/psychrotrophs-in-food-science/,"July 8, 2021","Psychrotrophy is an extremely important growth capability in food science.  It has relevance from both the perspective of food safety (for example withListeria monocytogenes) as well as food quality and spoilage (for example withPseudomonas fragi).  Psychrotrophic microorganisms are those that have a optimal growth temperature similar to mesophilic microorganisms, yet, they are capable of growth at refrigeration temperatures.  They are typically present in low concentrations in food products, but refrigerated storage selects for these psychrotrophs as the lower temperature inhibits the growth of mesophiles.  The inhibition of mesophilic growth allows the psychrotrophs to grow, essentially without competition, thereby eventually spoiling the product if given enough time.  Therefore, it is important to remember that refrigeration delays microbial spoilage of food because it largely selects for psychrotrophic microorganisms.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-safety, probiotics-and-gut-health, public-health",Antibiotic misuse and overuse,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/antibiotic-misuse-and-overuse/,"February 19, 2021","Antibiotics, discovered and commercially developed in the 1930s, have gone from being hailed as ‘magic bullets’ in 1940s human medical practice to nearly a scourge of humanity today, through decades of overuse and misuse in human and veterinary medicine.  As the World Health Organization states, they really do pose a big public health threat, across the world (Figure 1).  Despite being the foundation of ‘miracle’ cures in the early days, those gains in the war against human bacterial diseases are starting to unravel and are at serious risk of being reversed.  Not only that, but residual levels of antibiotics present in the food supply, resulting from widespread use in the agricultural environment has posed additional threats to human health.  These represent another facet of food safety, apart from the more common microbial food safety, which has wide-ranging public health consequences.  Seemingly, the lack of understanding around the molecular genetics of antibiotic resistance development and consumers’ comfort level with antibiotics, means that the general public appears to have very little concern for the environmental, personal health and public health consequences of antibiotic overuse and misuse.  Interestingly, the same people are quite possibly staunchly opposed to genetic modification in agriculture, which has no safety concerns, yet are comfortable with antibiotics, despite their negative impacts on the environment and on humanity.  In this article, I want to focus on the effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and the subsequent negative on that may arise for one’s personal health, which may or may not be able to be rectified through consumption of probiotic foods.  A further consequence could be increased susceptibility to foodborne disease.Figure 1: Antibiotic resistance is a significant public health issue across the planet.One’s gut microbiome, which develops shortly after birth, is a delicately balanced ecosystem of specific bacterial species characteristic of that individual.  While some generalisations can be made, the finer aspects are unique to each of us.  Overall, we still have much to learn and understand about the human gut microbiome (Iizumi, 2017).  However, what we are increasingly gaining an acknowledgement of, and indeed an appreciation for, are the diverse impacts good gut health may have for it’s host.  Conversely, the negative consequences of disruption to our specific balance of bacterial species can have serious detriment.While antibiotics are indeed ‘wonder drugs’ capable of eliminating or stopping the growth of many bacteria, there are downsides.  I’m not just talking about contribution to the devastation of antibiotic resistance prevailing in the world, or the side effects to antibiotic therapy an individual can experience, but to the disruption or sometimes decimation to one’s gut microbiome that may result during a course of antibiotics.  These are potentially big problems of a personal nature for us.It is acknowledged that the gut microbiome, and in fact our natural flora in other parts of the body, plays diverse positive roles in our personal health.  Originally this was thought to be localised, and so consumption of probiotics to ensure gut microbe balance was to have an impact on digestive health.  While this is certainly true, there’s an increasing appreciation of the wide effects.  Not only on physical health, but on mental health too – more information in thisblog articleI wrote towards the end of 2020.So with such a potential wide impact from disruption to one’s gut microbiota, how can we help our ‘friendly’ bacteria to help us?  Keeping personal antibiotic use to an absolute minimum is one way by simply saying no to antibiotics and exploring alternatives (Figure 2).  I for one, have not had to treat an infection of mine using antibiotics since 1990.  The comprehensive review paper (Ferreret al., 2017) on the topic of how the functioning of the gut microbiome is negatively impacted by antibiotic therapy reviews several studies that have demonstrated just how bad antibiotics are for our gut microbiota.  These authors cover numerous references to studies demonstrating the general reduction in total gut bacteria and also for specific taxa.  The complex diagram presented in Figure 3 shows how particular gut bacteria and negatively effected by antibiotics.  This really does highlight the magnitude of the (growing) problem around adverse effects on personal health of antibiotic therapy.Figure 2: Say NO to antibiotics.Figure 3: Complexities of how antibiotics negatively impact bacteria of the gut microbiome.  Source: Ferreret al.(2017).Despite this negativity, there are some interesting opposing results.  Martín-Núñezet al. (2019) found that the significant changes to the gut microbiota in human subjects with antibiotic therapy forHelicobacter pyloriinfection improved host glucose homeostatis.   So it’s not all doom and gloom, but that doesn’t mean we should be encouraging an imbalance of one’s gut microbiota!  Furthermore, Raymondet al. (2016) raises an interesting finding that although negative impacts to the gut microbiome composition take place, they are predictable and with knowledge of an individual’s original gut microbiome profile.Despite the above consequences in the human context, the fact remains that agricultural use of antibiotics accounts for the vast majority of antibiotic sales, in the US (Figure 4).  With the rapidly developing interest in plant-based foods, this will hopefully become less of a problem, but certainly, the absolute dominance of antibiotic use in the context of veterinary medicine as compared with human medicine, is yet another reason to consider plant-based dietary options.Figure 4: Use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine dominates over human medicine.So where does that leave us?  Antibiotics have a place, and if they are used for their intended purpose then it is unlikely we would be in the predicament we find ourselves in now.  Therefore, we all need to contribute and play our part to halt the deleterious effects on our personal health and on our public health by refusing to be part of antibiotic overuse and misuse.ReferencesFerrer, Manuel, Méndez-García, Celia, Rojo, David, Barbas, Coral, & Moya, Andrés.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-safety",The coliform group of bacteria,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-coliform-group-of-bacteria/,"February 13, 2021","Coliforms have historically been an important group of bacteria in food microbiology, for their practical role in serving as indicator organisms for possible faecal contamination and evenE. colicontamination.  This piece of writing was completed by Suryani Tan, one of my 2nd-year food microbiology students at The University of Melbourne in 2007.In order to be valuable as an assessor of faecal contamination, indicator organisms should satisfy the following criteria (Chapman and Hall 1997):• They should be a member of the normal intestinal flora of healthy people.• They should be exclusively intestinal in habitat and therefore exclusively faecal in origin if found outside the intestine.• Ideally they should only be found in humans.• They should be present when faecal pathogens are present and only when faecal pathogens are expected to be present.• They should be present in greater numbers than the pathogen they are intended to indicate.• They should be unable to grow outside the intestine with a die-off rate slightly less than the pathogenic organism.• They should be resistant to natural environmental conditions and to water and wastewater treatment processes in a manner equal to or greater than the pathogens of interest.• They should be easy to isolate, identify and enumerate.• They should be non-pathogenicThe finding of an indicator organism in a properly treated water indicates the presence of material of faecal origin and thus potential contamination (Chapman and Hall 1997).All of the above requirements are fulfilled by the coliform group. Coliform has been the principle means by which the sanitary quality of water is determined. Several other organism such as faecal Streptococci andClostridium perfringensare also used to provide supplementary information in certain circumstances as they also meet many of these requirements (Chapman and Hall 1997).Development of Coliforms as indicator organismsDirect isolation of specific pathogenic organisms were used as the earliest methods of water bacteriology. However, some difficulties were encountered with the detection of typhoid-like organisms. Bacteriologists attempting to overcome the difficulty of isolating such organisms found that human faeces contained large numbers of aerobic, Gram-negative organisms that resemble typhoid bacteria (Chapman and Hall 1997).These bacteria were subsequently found to be bile salt-tolerant, facultatively anaerobic organisms capable of growth and fermenting lactose at 37 degree Celsius. These bacteria are known as colifoms. Coliforms were quickly recognised as possible indicators of faecal pollution and procedures were developed to detect and estimate their numbers in raw waters. The most widely adopted method of isolation was inoculation of MacConkey Broth and incubation at 37 degree Celsius for 48 hours. Cultures producing acid and gas were subsequently subcultured onto MacConkey Agar to eliminate obligate anaerobes. A coliform became any organism that was isolated by this method. Faecal colifoms could produce gas from glucose at 47 degree Celsius while coliforms from non-faecal sources failed to grow at these temperatures. E.coli was also capable of growth and fermenting lactose at this temperature with the production of gas and producing indole from tryptophan (Chapman and Hall 1997).Definition of the coliform groupThe coliform group consists of several genera of bacteria belongings to the familyEnterobacteriaceae. These genera includedEscherichia, Citrobacter, EnterobacterandKlebsiella. The definition of the coliform group has been based on methods used for its detection rather than on the tenets of systematic bacteriology (Chapman and Hall 1997).Sources of coliforms in milk and how pathogenic they areGram-negative bacteria are the agents most often isolated from acute clinical cases of mastitis. The termcoliform mastitisis incorrectly used to identify mammary disease caused by all Gram-negative bacteria. The Genera classified as coliforms areEscherichia, Klebsiella, andEnterobacter.Gram-negative bacteria are considered environmental mastitis pathogens. One of the sources of coliforms contaminants in milk is through the transfer of Gram-negative bacteria from the mammary glands of infected cows to uninfected cows (Hogan and Smith 2003). However, this process appears minimal when compared with the constant environmental exposure. Coliform bacteria occupy many habitats in the cow’s environment. Escherichia coli are the normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of warm-blooded animals. BothKlebsiellaandEnterobacterspecies populate soils, grains, water, and intestinal tracts of animals. Gram-negative bacteria are usually isolated from any surface of the cow or her surroundings and cause other diseases (Hogan and Smith 2003). Coliform bacteria are among the aetiological agents commonly responsible for infectious respiratory and urogenital diseases in dairy cows. Although the mammary gland is not considered a natural habitat for coliform bacteria, many strains are capable of surviving and multiplying in the mammary gland (Hogan and Smith 2003).EndotoxinEndotoxin is the primary virulence factor of Gram-negative bacteria responsible for damage to the cow. Endotoxin refers to the lipopolysaccharide portion of the Gram-negative bacterial wall. Endotoxin is released from the bacteria at the time of cell death initiating an inflammatory response. Endotoxin does not directly affect secretory cell but distrupts the blood flow (Shuster 1991 cited in Hogan and Smith 2003). Signs of clinical mastitis include anorexic, fever, dehydration and diarrhea. Decreased milk production during clinical coliform mastitis results both directly and indirectly from the local and systematic effects of endotoxin. Coliform mastitis can result is bacteremia and septicemia as the blood-milk barrier is destroyed. Septicemia is rare but often fatal when it occurs (Hogan and Smith 2003).Gram-negative bacteria are the leading cause of clinical mastitis in well-managed dairies with low bulk tank milk somatic cell counts. Coliform pathogens account for the majority of peracute cases of clinical mastitis in a herd (Hogan and Smith 2003).Dry PeriodRates of new intramammary infections caused by coliforms are greater during the dry period than during lactation. During the dry period, susceptibility to intramammary infections is greatest the two weeks after drying off and the two weeks prior to calving. Many infections acquired during the dry period persist to lactation and become clinical cases. 65% of coliform clinical cases that occur in the first two months of lactation are intramammary infections that originated during the dry period. E.coli infections present at calving and early lactation most often originate during the last two weeks of the dry period (Hogan and Smith 2003).LactationColiform intramammary infections’ rate during lactation is highest at calving and decreases as days in milk advances. The average duration ofE. coliintramammary infections during lactation is less than ten days.  A major difference between intramammary infections caused by coliform bacteria and those caused by other Gram-negative bacteria is the duration that bacteria persist in the mammary gland. Intramammary infections caused bySerratiaandPseudomonasspecies often are chronic infections that may persist multiple lactations. Intramammary infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria seldom exceeds 5% of quarters in a herd, however greater than 25% of cows in well-managed herds are diagnosed yearly with clinical mastitis caused by coliforms. Therefore, these diseases caused by these bacteria is seldom great enough to cause bulk tank somatic cell counts (SCC) greater than 400 000/ml but approximately 85% of coliform infections will cause clinical mastitis. Hence, even low SCC herds can still have mastitis problems. The rate of clinical cases caused by Gram-negative bacteria average about 20 cases per 100 cows in a year. The severity of clinical cases caused by coliform bacteria ranges from mild local signs to severe systemic involvement. The majority of clinical coliform cases are characterized by abnormal milk and swollen gland. Only about 10% of clinical coliform cases results in systemic signs including fever, anorexic, and altered respiration. Furthermore, coliform bacteria can also cause peracute mastitis (Hogan and Smith 2003).ReferencesChapman and Hall. 1997. Coliform index and water-borne diseases.

Bacteria,bacteria,Concerns around sporeforming bacteria in dairy processing,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/concerns-around-sporeforming-bacteria-in-dairy-processing/,"January 26, 2021","Before I commenced my postdoc at RMIT University in July 2008, I applied to The University of Queensland in 2007 for a postdoctoral fellowship, which I was unsuccessful for.  The text in this blog post formed part of my research proposal.Bacteria from the genusBacillusandGeobacillusare ubiquitous (Chenet al., 2004) and therefore can enter the raw milk supply from many sources (Meeret al., 1991).  However,Geobacillus, being thermophilic with an optimal growth temperature of 55-65 °C (Nazinaet al., 2001), are more likely to be present on heated milk processing equipment, particularly as biofilms (Flintet al., 2001).  Although they are present in freshly drawn raw milk at low levels (Flintet al., 2001), they may be present in long-life dairy products (Westhoff & Dougherty, 1981), and are very important due to their potential involvement in spoilage of those products.  This involvement has been recognised for a long time (Grinstead & Clegg, 1955).  High levels of vegetative cells may cause spoilage of reconstituted milk powder (Flintet al., 2001) andG. stearothermophilusin particular associated with flat sour spoilage of low-acid foods, including milk (Ito, 1981), especially evaporated milk (Kalogridou-Vassiliadouet al., 1989).  Furthermore, in milk powder, spores from thermophiles are mostly present up to approximately 5.0 x 102/g while a typical concentration for their vegetative cells is up to approximately 104/g (Luck & Jordaan, 1978; Chopraet al.,1984).  Some species are also important spoilers of acidic food products and for some applications, the mere presence of spores from these organisms is cause for concern (Jensonet al., 2001).  In addition to spoilage, corrosion of stainless steel and reduced manufacturing efficiency can result from the presence of biofilms (Parkaret al., 2004).  WhileG. stearothermophilusis considered non-pathogenic (Ito, 1981), the involvement ofB. lichinformisin human diseases of various locations within the body has been reported (Santiniet al., 1995).The persistence of these organisms in the dairy processing environment is cause for concern as they readily form biofilms, which contribute vegetative cells or spores to the raw milk.  In addition, as variousBacillusspp. have been found in long-life milk products (Mostertet al., 1979), it is likely that thermophilic (such asG. stearothermophilus) or thermotolerant (such asB. licheniformis) species in particular, may survive heat treatment of milk, even UHT processing.  Even if the cells do not survive, their spores will.  They will then germinate under favourable conditions, and growth of vegetative cells can result in flat sour spoilage (Kalogridou-Vassiliadou, 1992).  It is widely acknowledged that these spores are highly resistant to many physicochemical treatments, such as heat, drying, radiation and chemicals.Processing of long-life dairy products involves eliminating all microbes, therefore, effectively sterilising the product.  While sterility is the aim, in practice, commercial sterility is achieved, which refers to a particular failure rate or particular percentage of non-sterile units of product.  Ideally, heat processing of long-life products should eliminate vegetative cells and spores.  Due to the heat resistance of spores, moist heat, at temperatures in excess of 121°C are generally required to inactivate them.  This is especially the case withG. stearothermophilus, whose spores are regarded as one of the most heat resistant of all aerobic microorganisms (Watanabeet al. 2003).  Even at 124°C, a heating time of 63 sec. is still required to reduce theG. stearothermophilusspore count by one log (Feeherryet al., 1987).  As a result of this extreme heat resistance, inactivation ofG. stearothermophilisspores is generally regarded as effective heat treatment to result in a sterile product.A disadvantage of high temperature heat treatment of food products is the alteration that can potentially result to the physical, chemical and/or nutritional composition of the food.  This is particularly true with milk, which is relatively heat-sensitive, as distinctive flavours and aromas result after UHT processing.  This flavour and aroma has been a major problem in some countries as it has directly prevented the acceptance of UHT milk.  One of those countries is Australia, with UHT milk sales comprising a small percentage of all fluid milk products sold (Perkins & Deeth, 2001).  Therefore, an increase in UHT milk sales could be generated in Australia by its production without the accompanying characteristic aroma and flavour which many people find unpleasant.  An approach could be the use of means other than heat to sensitise the spores.  These injured spores may then be completely inactivated by more gentle heat treatments, such as 115-120°C, stated by Cravenet al.(2001) as the typical temperature of processing for high heat milk powder.  In addition to providing a means to produce long-life milk without severe heat treatment, much information regarding the alteration of the physiology and structure of spores could be determined.ThermotolerantB. licheniformisandG. stearothermophilisare amongst the most often isolated species on dairy farms, compared to other related species (Scheldmanet al., 2005).  In one study ofBacillusspp. in the dairy environment,B. lichinformiswas the most frequently isolated from raw milk and environmental sources and its spores were dominant in milk powder (Criellyet al., 1994).  Therefore, they are always going to be present in milk production/processing areas and will almost always be present in raw milk, especially because there is no real seasonal variation in occurrence of vegetative cells of these species in raw milk, with low and high occurrence reported at all times of the year (Phillipset al., 1986).  Some of these bacteria, including those responsible for flat sour spoilage, may grow at temperatures as low as 30°C which is why strict temperature control of UHT milk during storage and distribution is imperative (Olson & Sorrells, 1992).  Moreover, the pathogenic species are thermotolerant mesophiles and therefore they are able to grow well at these temperatures.ReferencesChen, L., Coolbear, T., Daniel, R.M.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality, fungi, yeast",Complexities of shelf-life extension,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/complexities-of-shelf-life-extension/,"January 18, 2021","Food spoilage and the subsequent waste is costly.  The convenience of a long shelf-life benefit all along the supply chain from farm to fork.  Therefore, it is understandable that many start-up food manufacturers undergoing initial, or advanced, prototype development wish to extend the shelf-life of their product, for obvious reasons – today’s post-manufacture supply chains can be long and complex, and expensive too, especially if a cold chain is required.  Thus, achieving a lengthy shelf-life at ambient temperature is many people’s dream!  This also holds true for established food manufacturers, particularly when seeking new, more distant markets (especially in climate locations where temperature control is unreliable) or attempting to become a better proposition for selling in a physical, ‘brick and mortar’ store, where retailers wish to display for as long as possible to avoid price reductions due to food passing its Best Before date, hence cutting into their profit margin.It is not uncommon to look at shelf-life extension or optimisation, largely in terms of the finished product.  What can we do to the food to have it last longer?  Process differently or include preservatives are the two most common thoughts that come to mind when people look at approaches to increase shelf-life, although more brand owners are considering reformulation as a way to lengthen shelf-life.  Ultimately, reformulation should achieve one of two outcomes; I) provide some kind of an antimicrobial substance or II) alter the intrinsic conditions of the food such that the microorganisms cannot grow or grow more slowly.  Natural antimicrobial substances, such as from the inclusion of botanical essential oils (Figure 1) or bacteriocins are examples of such antimicrobial substances that will exert a preservation effect.Figure 1: The four best antibacterial botanic essential oils.If we consider the intrinsic conditions, this is where are really getting back to basics, basic microbial physiology that is learn during introductory microbiology classes … meaning their are factors which govern microbial growth and if these factors cannot be met, the microbes cannot grow, it really is as simple as that.  Examples of such factors are pH and water activity (Figure 2) and in turn, there are various ways to achieve these.  Water activity for example, can be lowered through an increase in salts or sugars.  Really though, the best indicators as to the shelf-life of a food and what is able to spoil it is pH and water activity.  Temperature as an extrinsic factor (Figure 2) can then offer further shelf-life benefits.Figure 2: Some intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors that can influence shelf-life.Water activity is a concept that is sometimes misunderstood, yet plays an absolutely critical role in the shelf-life properties of a product.  So what is water activity?  Is it the same as moisture?  Why is it even important?  Let me delve into these a little – moisture is the water content overall, but within what is considered moisture, there is water bound to food molecules and the like and free water in the food product.  It is this free water, and this free water only, that is available for microbial growth – it is measure on a scale between 0 (minimum) and 1 (maximum) (Figure 3).  Therefore, the concepts of moisture (total water content) and water activity (amount of free water that is able to be used by microorganisms for their growth) are related but different.  While moisture may give an indication of water activity, you cannot be sure, thus it is water activity, which is the definitive measure as to how much water is available in a food product to support growth of microorganisms.Figure 3: Water activity scale.However, if one is really going to optimise shelf-life then a myriad of other factors come into play, right from farm to fork.  While HACCP is the way that food safety risks can be managed and minimised, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) during primary production (Figure 4) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) during manufacture are key elements to ‘squeeze’ every possible amount of shelf-life out of a product.  As a result, shelf-life optimisation needs to be considered in context of the entire agrifood farm to fork supply chain.  There are not a lot of practices that many consider as impactful on shelf-life.  As examples, farm hygiene, manufacturing environment design and airflow are some which might be forgotten as what needs to be considered to optimise one’s product’s shelf-life.  Furthermore, practices of workers is key, as are Standard Operating Practices (SOPs), which may need to be reviewed and updated.Figure 4: Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)Thus, many, many factors come into play when looking extending or optimisation the shelf-life of a food product.  It isn’t as straight-forward as changing processing conditions or adding in some preservatives.  There’s no doubt that it is a complex process requiring painstaking consideration and analysis of primary production, your suppliers, transport, manufacturing environment, personnel, retail conditions and possible temperature and other abuse by consumers during domestic transport and storage.  Therefore, knowing that these factors could be influential isn’t enough to optimise or extend shelf-life, it is vital to know how these factors could come into play in decreasing the shelf-life of your specific product.","food microbiology, food preservation, food spoilage, shelf life"
Bacteria,bacteria,Pasteurisation of eggs and egg products,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/pasteurisation-of-eggs-and-egg-products/,"January 13, 2021","This blog article is an extract (very slightly modified/revised) from a student literature review conducted in 2008 by Jiahui Tan, a 3rd-year student of mine at RMIT University in Melbourne.Egg products (liquid whole egg)In the US, the most marketed typology is the pasteurized liquid egg product (81.4% of the total production), followed by frozen (13.3%) and dried (5.3%) product. In addition, the liquid whole egg (LWE) (Figure 1) is the most commonly processed product at 64% compared to the individual white and yolk. (Hidalgo et. al., 2008)  Hence, the LWE has drawn special attention to the food technologist fundamentally due to its demand and the consumer appreciation for its high protein content of 12.8 – 13.4%. (Li-Chan et. al., 1995). The low cost of LWE being used in prepared meals in order to provide texture, flavour and structure indicates that it has been an important ingredient. (Punidadas & McKellar, 1999) However, the functional properties and sensory attributes of LWE are affected by pasteurization, which is the fundamental process to eliminate pathogenic microorganism.Figure 1: An example LWE product.Standard Processing Method (Pasteurisation)The most common preservation method for the general egg products is the thermal treatment, having the principle of inactivation of microorganisms by application of heat for a certain time. Pasteurisation of egg products have become mandatory in Australia and the Food Standard Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) require that LWE be heated to a temperature not lower than 64°C for at least 2.5 minutes and immediately rapidly cooled to a temperature not greater than 7°C. (FSANZ, 2008a) This data are similar to Food Standards Agency (FSA),. a regulation used in United Kingdom (UK). However, it was claim by the British researchers that the current regulations approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States (US) of using 60oC for at least 3.5 minutes is insufficient treatment to ensure a satisfactory product in the UK. (Cunningham, 1995) This time-temperature combination for US regulations was mentioned to have an important advantage of determining the adequacy of pasteurization by using an enzymatic test, but it does not work for time-temperature as recommended in Australian and British regulations. (Cunningham, 1995)Advantage of PasteurisationPasteurisation represents the best understood technology and is identified as the most effective method for elimination of pathogens in eggs products. (Calderon-Miranda et. al., 1999; Unluturk et. al., 2008) According to FSANZ, FSA and FDA regulations, the LWE must not be sold or used in the manufacture of food unless it has been pasteurized and cooled within the conditions stated above. In a study by Manas et. al. (2003), the time-temperature combinations used in the three countries should be able to provide a 5-9 log cycle reduction in the number ofSalmonella(Figure 2). This indicates the importance of a treatment to reduce theSalmonellaload as only egg products that areSalmonella-negative can be sold.Figure 2: Salmonella sp.Hidalgo (2008) suggests that a pasteurized egg product can reach a shelf-life of 28 days with more severe heat treatments using aseptic packaging. It is crucial that a starting material has good hygiene quality and is adequately handled during breaking. Ultimately, an extension in shelf life of an egg product is determined by its ability to stay contamination-free throughout its processing.Disadvantage of PasteurizationAlthough pasteurisation is the most available technique and literature has little evidence in causing any significant change in egg nutrition value, it may affect the functional properties of the LWE such as the foaming, coagulation and emulsifying properties. (Gongora-Nieto et. al., 2003; Hermawan et. al., 2004) Examples of a classic test by Cunningham (2005), are beating rate, meringue stability and angel cake-volume. As for the coagulation ability, it can be reflected by the stiffness of custard and the indication of the emulsifying power of whole egg can be evaluated by the stability of mayonnaise.Ponce et. al., (1998), reported that egg proteins are susceptible to coagulation or thermal denaturation with the formation or destruction of covalent bonds (Figure 3). Hence, pasteurisation may affect the sensorial quality of LWE, leading to a less desirable product. With the alteration to the colour, texture and impairing of functional properties, it loses the important value of LWE to consumers.Figure 3:  Process egg protein denaturation.Susceptibility to MicroorganismAlthough the contents of freshly laid eggs are sterile, the shell surface contains many bacteria. Higalgo (2008) reported that it is very important to avoid any contact between the internal egg content with the dirty shell surfaces which can reach to 107-108cfu/g. The LWE may be contaminated during processing and supports growth of pathogens such asCampylobacter(Neil et. al, 1985; Evans et. al., 2003),Listeria monocytogenes(Brackett & Beuchat, 1991; Dobbenie et. al., 1995),Salmonella(Manas et al.,  2003; Messens et. al., 2005),Yersinia enterocolitica(Hanna, et. al., 1977; Favier et. al., 2005). The contamination and growth of bacteria in egg products can alter the sensory aspects and is potentially dangerous for consumption as it could compromise the consumer safety.ReferencesBrackett, R.

Bacteria,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Probiotics and their viability in foods and gastrointestinal passage.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/probiotics-and-their-viability-in-foods-and-gastrointestinal-passage/,"January 4, 2021","The text of this blog article was originally written by Amy Tsang, a 3rd-year food technology student of mine at RMIT University in 2009.  I have provided some slight updates/changes/revisions.While probiotics now exist (for example,Bacilluscoagulans) that are able to withstand pasteurisation and high pressure processing, there’s no doubt of the ongoing importance of the issue of viability of probiotics, given adequate amounts of the organisms reaching the appropriate place in the gastrointestinal tract is a requisite for their success, and the multitude of factors that can negatively impact probiotic survival during manufacture, in food and during gastrointestinal passage, as noted in the image above.Probiotics continue to attracted much interest from consumers; who are concerned with their personal diet and lifestyle. These consumers expect that the functional foods they consume will exert clear health benefits for their digestive system; especially in Europe where gut health is a key component for the benefits provided by functional foods (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002). Future research into probiotics may also help to alleviate many health issues such as allergies or even particular types of cancers. Currently there are many studies focused on probiotic survival through the gastrointestinal environment.Misconceptions about probiotics need to be defended when placed under scrutiny (Gorbach, 2002). To counter misconceptions of probiotics, detailed research and human/clinical studies need to be conducted by scientists to prove to consumers that probiotics have health promoting properties. In addition, consumer education is also important; if probiotics were to become a part of the daily diet; appropriate scientific facts and information should be made readily available for consumers. Without consumer confidence, the probiotic industry would not prosper.There are several major issues that need to be addressed before developing new probiotic products or re-formulating products for consumption.  The viability and stability of probiotics and maintaining an acceptable number of viable cells above food standard requirements throughout the whole shelf life of the product and ensuring specific probiotic strains are chosen that can withstand the gastrointestinal stresses present in that environment; these have all been major challenges for the food industry (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002). These requirements highlight the need for innovative solutions such as new technological advancements; however maintenance of low production costs will also be high on the agenda as the solutions need to be financially viable for food manufacturers and consumers alike.Yoghurt, a popular dairy product with probiotic health benefits, has established the foundations for further research into other potential probiotic functional foods such as; probiotic drinks, non dairy beverages; vegetable and fruit juices, desserts for vegetarians, baby foods, and cereal based products (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002; Heenan, 2004 et. al; Prado et. al, 2008; Lee & Salminen, 1995).Various ideas towards the method of benefit offered by probiotics have been hypothesised. Although these significant methods have not been completely established, the possibilities include; rivalry for nutrients, secretion of microbial substances, blocking of adhesion sites, decrease in virulence, blocking of toxin receptor sites, immune stimulation and suppression of toxin production (Fooks et. al, 1999). The competition for nutrients is quite a significant factor for any bacteria thriving in the gastrointestinal tract. Various bacterial species are quite specific in their nutritional requirements and so one particular population may deplete nutrients at the expense of another species (Fooks et. al, 1999); thus if probiotics were used in this circumstance it would be highly beneficial to the gut flora, where health promoting bacteria may predominate. In general terms, probiotic foods and supplements are expected to restore the balance in the gut; given there are sufficient numbers, which is generally 106cfu/g (Elahi et.al, 2008; Lee & Salminen, 1996).Probiotic effectiveness can be further enhanced with the inclusion of probiotics for a symbiotic effect. According to (Fooks et. al, 1999) this combination of one probiotic with another probiotic can enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria overall.To further highlight the importance of probiotic bacterial survival, there are also other issues to consider. Although probiotic bacteria in food products may be able to survive the initial fermentation, production process; the storage and the gastrointestinal tract are also of great concern, probiotic bacteria may be susceptible to extreme and harsh environments. As discussed by (Lacroix & Yildirim, 2007) the storage conditions can have an impact on probiotic bacteria such as oxygen stress, competition with other organisms, variability in temperature and moisture content, given that the probiotic bacteria do survive during storage they are then exposed to the gastrointestinal tract.Furthermore, the gastrointestinal tract will have extreme acidic conditions present in the stomach and enzyme activity will be present, thus the composition of the environment may not favour the probiotic bacteria and presence of bile salts in the small intestine may inhibit the growth of the probiotic bacteria ingested (Lacroix & Yildirim, 2007). These are typical stresses which probiotic bacteria may be subjected to, therefore probiotic bacteria chosen for products should be those that can adapt to extreme conditions and changing environments (Lacroix & Yildirim, 2007). Therefore due to such conditions, it is not always likely that sufficient numbers of probiotic bacteria will reach the appropriate gut location to exert their beneficial health effects. A research project was conducted by (Gibson & Brostoff, 2005 – apologies, citation details cannot be found!) to test commercially available supplements that contained strains of probiotic bacteria and their survival in the gastrointestinal environment. Their results demonstrated thatLactobacillus spp.were resistant to the gastric environment, however they were sensitive to the upper intestinal content, on the contraryBifidobacterium spp.displayed sensitivity to the stomach environment but were able to survive well in the upper intestine. This study highlighted the significance of different probiotic species and their diverse capacity to survive within the intestinal environment.ReferencesElahi, S., Farnell, P., Thurlow, K.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-safety",Food safety and prevention of foodborne illness during the summer holidays,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-safety-and-prevention-of-foodborne-illness-during-the-summer-holidays/,"December 25, 2020","Here we have a Christmas Day special, an article on how to be food-safe this Christmas, and indeed throughout summer.  This article is written by our guest blogger, Collette Arnheim.  Collette is broadly skilled, and qualified in food science (from The University of Melbourne) and dietetics (from Deakin University).  Take heed of her timely and exemplary advice and have a food-safe summer.You can find out more about Collette from her LinkedIn profile –https://www.linkedin.com/in/collette-arnheim/As we head into the summer holidays here in Australia, our days are bound to be filled with picnics, BBQs and outdoor entertaining.  As we take advantage of a COVID-free summer, what doesn’t quite take a summer holiday and may be more prevalent in the hotter months are bacterial pathogens.Bacterial pathogens are those bacteria that can lead to foodborne illness or as we know it “food poisoning” and can cause harm to humans if ingested.  Generally symptoms of food poisoning only last a few days, however if you have ever suffered from it, you will know that those two days are not pleasant!It was estimated that 4.1 million cases of foodborne illness occurred in Australian circa 2010.  With the World Health Organization estimating that one in ten people worldwide will suffer with some form of gastroenteritis foodborne related illness.The main types of bacteria that can cause foodborne illness and can double in number but not be seen when left out in our hot Australian summer sun areCampylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus,Listeria monocytogenes, E. coliandSalmonella.WithSalmonellaandListeria monocytogenesbeing the leading causes of death.The common signs of symptoms of food poisoning are diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, nausea, abdominal cramps, headaches, muscular pain and fatigue.  In certain populations like the elderly, pregnant women and children, food poisoning can cause serious risk and can even be fatal.Transmission of these pathogens into our food system is commonly found at the processing end of the food product however can also occur through the whole food supply chain.  Contamination of our food can be caused by uncleaned faecal material from animals or contaminated water or soil.  Correct food handling is therefore critical to prevent these foodborne pathogens from spreading to our picnic tables.So what can we do to prevent food poisoning during the summer months?Correct food handling–Washing of our fruits and vegetables before consumption.  Washing of hands before preparation and eating.   Not preparing raw meat especially poultry on the same unwashed surface as fruits and vegetables.Read storage instructions on food products –Check the storage instructions on the food products that you buy.  Some will need to be stored in the fridge immediately like fish, cold meats and cheese and others will be able to be left out like fruits and vegetables and non-perishable items. It’s best to check the label before storing your shopping.Reading and knowing the difference between best before date and used by date–Best Before – this product can be consumed after the date however it may compromise the quality of the product.Use By – these products should not be consumed after the date as it can increase the chance of the product being contaminated and increase risk of foodborne illness.Know what you are preparing –Be prepared when packing your picnic, what are the foods that will need to stay cool in an Esky/cooler box (cheese and deli meats) and which ones can be left in the basket without having to be chilled (chips and water crackers). The same goes for when entertaining at home, plus be mindful of serving up a little at a time so that you can restock from the fridge, rather than letting the food stay out on the bench.Temperature danger zone  –Any temperature between 5 °C (40 °F) and 60 °C (140 °F) is known as the danger zone (Figure 1) as bacteria can grow to unsafe levels and cause us to get sick.  It is especially important to not leave food out in the sun for more than 2 hours, which when celebrating in our summer sun can sometimes be hard.Figure 1: The danger zone sourced fromhttps://foodsafety.asn.au/.Keeping food below 5 °C (40 °F) can prevent most bacteria from growing and when eating hot foods we should aim for temperatures above 60° C (140 °F).The general rule for eating food when left outside the fridge within the temperature danger zone is the two/ four hour rule.0 -2 hours – can be eaten2-4 hours – will need to be eaten immediately4 -6 hours – will need to be disposed of.– Freezing and refrigeration of left oversIf food has been left out under the 2 hour rule make sure to refrigerate or freeze immediately, this will slow down or stop any bacterial growth.   Make sure that the fridge is not over packed when storing leftovers, as this can cause an increase in the temperature to above 5 °C (40 °F) and increase the chance of bacterial growth.–Thorough re heating of leftovers.When re-heating left overs, make sure that the meal is heated to above 60 °C (140 °F) and kept warm at that temperature or above.Following these general rules will help to keep you safe over the holidays and help to prevent any food poisoning from occurring.Have a fun and safe summer.Written by –Collette Arnheim,Dietitian, Nutritionist and Food Scientist.BSc, MSc Dietetics and Grad Dip Food Science.https://www.linkedin.com/in/collette-arnheim/References:1.

Bacteria,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, yeast",Kombucha is not naturally probiotic.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/kombucha-is-not-naturally-a-probiotic-product/,"November 13, 2020","This topic is in a pretty hot space, because both kombucha and probiotics are very much ‘in fashion’ and trending at the present time across the worldwide, as can be seen in the all-time Google Trends for this word which has showed a slow rise over the last seven years, peaking this year during the third week of January (Figure 1).  Leading the way in search interest on Google for “kombucha” are New Zealand, followed by Australia (Figure 2).  This shows how interest in kombucha is at an all-time high in 2020, especially in New Zealand and Australia, followed by Canada and the United States.  Google interest in “probiotics” has shown an increase ever since records began (Figure 3), with a peak at a similar time earlier this year (late January/early February).  Search interest from Australia (5th) and New Zealand (6th) still ranks highly, although the United States (2nd) and Canada (4th) rank higher, with Singapore at number three.  Perhaps surprising is Trinidad and Tobago at number one – small sample size perhaps?  In any case, kombucha and probiotics are of much interest, particularly from westernised nations of the world with advanced economies.Figure 1: Global Google Trends for “kombucha”.Figure 2: Top five countries searching for “kombucha” on Google Trends.Figure 3: Global Google Trends for “probiotic”.Figure 4: Top five countries for “probiotic” on Google Trends.This strong interest, resurgence is fascinating, given the age-old origins of both kombucha and provides, essentially stretching back millennia for kombucha in particular.  At this stage I want to introduce the distinction between probiotic foods and beverages and fermented foods and beverages.  While there is certainly overlap, in many instances, they are certainly not interchangeable terms.  Let us just consider that all foods/beverages could be categorised as:Fermented and probiotic – for example most yogurts and kimchi.Non-fermented and probiotic – for example some popcorn and some protein bars.Fermented and non-probiotic – for example natural kombucha and sourdough bread.Non-fermented and non-probiotic – for example peanut butter or ice cream.Kombucha is naturally, a fermented and non-probiotic beverage (tea) of ancient Chinese origin with consumption for “magical” properties being known from the Qin dynasty (around 220 BC) with subsequent historical consumption in China, Germany and Russia (Greenwaltet al., 2000).  However even today, despite mass consumption as a functional food for various postulated health benefits, no real evidence of any health benefits exists in the human contextin vivoalthough promising results have been seenin vitroand with animal models (Figure 5) (Moraleset al., 2020).Figure 5: Laboratory testing, animal models and human success to demonstrate health benefits of kombucha. Source: Morales et al. (2020).Kombucha is produced by what is referred to as a SCOBY, aSymbioticCultureOfBacteria andYeasts and is widely known in consumer circles as “tea fungus” (Figure).  Within this symbiotic community (Figures 6 and 7), bacterial diversity is limited to mostly species ofAcetobacterwhile a myriad of yeast species are likely to be present (Teohet al., 2004).  A detailed review by Moraleset al.(2020) has identified the following microorganism groups isolated from kombucha; 22 species of acetic acid bacteria from six genera, 3 species of lactic acid bacteria from two genera and 41 species of yeast from 21 genera –AcetobacterandGluconacetobacterare the bacterial genera with the most species isolated from kombucha whileHanseniasporaandZygosaccharomycesare the yeast genera with the most species isolated.Figure 6: An advanced fermentative state of kombucha (Source: Jayabalanet al., 2014).Figure 7: Microscopic view of SCOBY.  Source: Greenwaltet al.(2000).So, while kombucha is indeed a fermented beverage, it is not fermented with probiotic microorganisms – it is fermented with yeasts and acetic acid bacteria that do not have any demonstrated probiotic benefit.  Therefore, their only role is to turn tea into kombucha through their growth and metabolic activity, thus producing a variety of compounds in the process (Figure 8).  Thus, while you may in fact be consuming live culture in kombucha, these microorganisms that have been used to make kombucha will do little for your gut wellbeing.  From studies conducted on the microbial content of kombucha, there is admittedly some lactic acid bacteria present sometimes, however while they MAY be probiotic, they are most likely present at too low a concentration to confer any health benefit to to the host, which is of course a key element of the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of probiotics.Figure 8: How acetic acid bacteria and yeast ferment tea into kombucha.  Source: Tranet al.(2020).Manufacturers have thus sought to capitalise on the probiotic image of kombucha through the addition of probiotics to the product, that have no role in actually making the product.  This is fine, but it’s worth knowing that such probiotics are an additive because as mentioned above, they do not function in the fermentation process.  Therefore, from this perspective, kombucha has little difference from any other probiotic food or drink to which probiotics are added, to make them probiotic products, of which there are diverse types on the market these days, such as popcorn (Figure 9).Figure 9: A probiotic popcorn product on sale in a Melbourne supermarket. Photo by @pdbuttonLast point, read the science, believe the science and remember to only trust credible sources so as not to be misled by erroneous information that is more easily found online (Figure 10).  While kombucha might be delicious, they are not naturally probiotic and need to be made probiotic through the addition of probiotics (therefore, read the label and see if it is probiotic or a fermented beverage only) and there is certainly no robust evidence that kombucha has any human health benefits, despite such claims below in the popular health media online.Figure 10: An erroneous “blanket” reference to the probiotic and other health properties for all kombucha products.ReferencesGreenwalt, C.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality",Bacterial lipolytic spoilage of bovine milk,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/bacterial-lipolytic-spoilage-of-bovine-milk/,"October 29, 2020","The AIFST, as the professional association for food scientists and food technologists in Australia, has many awards available for its members.  One of these for young members (under 30 years of age) is theJohn Christian Young Food Microbiologist award.  In 2006, a few months before my 30th birthday, I submitted the below 500 word summary of an aspect of my PhD research I was undertaking at the time, as a collaboration between Food Science Australia (CSIRO), The University of Melbourne and The University of Queensland.  By the way, I was not selected as a finalist for this award.Spoilage can occur in milk by a variety of different means.  Pasteurised milk is most often spoiled due to microbial growth whereas enzymatic spoilage predominates in UHT milk.  This is due to the heat treatments applied.  Pasteurisation conditions are typically heating at 72 °C for 15 sec while UHT treatment conditions are approximately 140 °C for 4 sec.  This variation in heat treatment results in a commercially sterile product (UHT milk) and a product in which pathogens have been eliminated but spoilage microbes still exist (pasteurized milk).  As microbes are longer present in UHT milk, spoilage takes place due to other mechanisms.  Lipase is naturally present in raw milk or can also result from bacterial growth.  UHT processing doesn’t inactivate bacterial lipase, the action of which in UHT milk, can result in lipolytic rancidity.  This takes place when the lipase catalyses the reaction resulting in release of a fatty acid from a mono-, di- or triacylglycerol molecule.  Thus, free fatty acids (FFAs) result along with a glycerol molecule (Figure 1).  Combinations of particular FFAs, when present at certain concentrations in UHT milk, can impart characteristic flavours.  These flavours are perceived as off-flavours, and when this has occurred, he product has spoiled and therefore, reached the end of its shelf-life.Figure 1: A cartoon depiction of how the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) can lose its integrity and become susceptible to the action of lipase, releasing free fatty acids (FFAs) from, in this case, a triacylglycerol molecule.The most common methods in use for measurement of FFAs are the extraction-titration techniques (Deeth, 1993).  Examples are the method of Salihet al.(1977) and that described by Deethet al.(1975), which was used in this experiment.  Salihet al.(1977) mentions that recovering a high percentage of hydrophilic short-chain FFAs without extracting other hydrophilic acids can be a problem.  IDF (1991) has compared the percentage recovery of individual FFAs and found that the procedure described by Salihet al.(1977) is superior to the Deethet al.(1975) method in this regard.  Although improved results are expected, the technique is tedious and time-consuming.  This would be a reason to favour the Deethet al.(1975) method over that of Salihet al.(1977). Other methods which have been reported include spectrophometric methods.  For example, those based on the conversion of the FFAs to copper soaps, with subsequent extraction and then reaction with a colorimetric reagent for detection at 440 nm (Shipeet al., 1980).  This method has been modified more recently for detection of FFAs resulting from lipolytic activity of bacteria growing in a model broth system with various lipid sources as lipase substrate (Leuschneret al., 1997).For detailed analysis of the specific FFAs present in milk, gas chromatography (GC) methods are widely used.  These methods can be used for underivatised (de Jong & Badings, 1990; Wijesundera & Drury, 1999; Cardaket al., 2003) or derivatised (Ulberth & Schrammel, 1995; Wikinget al., 2003; Silvaet al., 2005) FFAs, which are usually free fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), although Rosenfeld (2002) discusses various options for derivatisation of FFAs.  A new alternative method unrelated to extraction-titration or GC is based on the use of fourier transform infra red (FT-IR) techniques (Pedersen, 2004).ReferencesCardak, A.D., Yetismeyen, A. & Bruckner, H.

Bacteria,bacteria,Zeaxanthin production by Sphingobacterium multivorum,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/zeaxanthin-production-by-sphingobacterium-multivorum/,"October 14, 2020","This blog article is a small extract from an Honours research proposal (that didn’t proceed), written in 2008 by one of my students at RMIT University, Weny Tjong.  I have provided some current updates in particular areas.  Even though this article would be considered within the realm of industrial microbiology and biotechnology, the connection to food microbiology and food science in general is because this purified zeaxanthin was to be used to fortify food products.One potentialSphingobacteriumsp. to be considered as a source of zeaxanthin isSphingobacterium multivorum(Figure 1) as it is a non fastidious and (generally) non-pathogenic bacterium that rapidly accumulates zeaxanthin through their fermentation (Sajilata, Singhal & Kamat, 2008).  Although generally pathogenic, there are a handful of reports of disease caused by the species (for example: Abroet al., 2016 and Mendeset al., 2016).  Bacteria are seen to have great potential for industrial production of carotenoids (Ramet al., 2020). The suggestion of its rapid zeaxanthin accumulation is very much supported by Alcantara and Sanchez (1999), and Garnett et al. (1998). The ATCC number of this bacterial strain is55238. It is reported that under proper fermentation conditions, zeaxanthin can be synthesized by this bacterium with virtually no significant amount of other carotenoids (Gierhart, 1994). Hence, the difficulty in purifying zeaxanthin from its closely related carotenoids can be eliminated with the use ofSphingobacterium multivorumand its descendants.Figure 1: Gram stain ofSphingobacterium multivorum.SphingobacteriummultivorumcharacteristicsWith a few exceptions,Sphingobacteriumsp. can be categorized into two categories: strongly proteolytic – digest gelatine, casein and coagulated serum- and non proteolytic (Gierhart, 1994).S. meningosepticum(biovar IIa) andS. indologenes(viovar IIb) are always proteolytic; other Flavobacteria are not.Sphingobacterium multivivorumis non proteolytic.S. multivorumgrows in smooth, non pigmented colonies of size less than 1 mm on a 1 day sheep blood agar plate (Gierhart, 1994) (Figure 2). They are oxidase-positive, catalase-positive, Gram negative rods, non-motile, strongly sucrose-positive, always mannitol-negative and ethanol-negative, and urea-positive. The plate shows no zones of inhibition surrounding penicillin, vancomycin, and polymyxin disks.Figure 2:Sphingobacterium multivorumon blood agar.S. multivorumzeaxanthin productionThe stereoisomeric isomers of zeaxanthin appear to be small, subtle and almost insignificant. Nonetheless, when it comes to retinal tissue, only the 3R-3’R zeaxanthin stereoisomer (Figure 3) is properly taken up and used by human retinal cells (Garnett et al., 1998).Figure 3: Isomers of zeaxanthin and comparison with lutein.Traces quantities of the meso-zeaxanthin isomers have been reportedly to be found in retinal tissues (Garnett et al., 1998). However, it is argued that these trace quantities are probably the result of molecular conversion of the lutein precursors under some conditions.S. multivorumonly produces desired R-R isomers and do not synthesize other undesired S–S or S-R isomers of zeaxanthin and significant quantities of other carotenoids such as β-carotene or lutein, which might compete against zeaxanthin for the alimentary uptake after oral ingestion (Garnett et al. 1998). The concentration of the zeaxanthin obtained after the cell fermentation can be concentrated to approximately 5 to 20% by simple and inexpensive steps such as solvent extraction, and/or purified to much higher levels by other methods if desired.Factors That Affect Zeaxanthin Production inSphingobacteriumsp.Nitrogen and carbon sourcesStudies were done by Alcantara and Sanchez in 1999 whereby the growth ofSphingobacteriumsp. utilizing different carbon and nitrogen sources were observed. The result of this observation is shown in Figure 6. Sucrose and both asparagine and glutamine were found to be the best stimulator for growth and pigment formation. The carotenoid production and glucose consumption increased in respect to asparagine concentration that depletes as it is used bySphingobacteriumsp. as their primary source of nitrogen for growth and zeaxanthin production. The presence of asparagine together with high glucose concentrations in fact decreases pigment production although the biomass formation is unaffected (Alcantara and Sanchez, 1999). However, without glucose, asparagine could not support growth of the cells and subsequent zeaxanthin production.(Alcantara & Sanchez, 1999)CD: Chemically definedOD: Optical density^Effect of different carbon and nitrogen sources on growth and zeaxanthin productionThe Presence of Corn Steep LiquorCorn steep liquor is known to be beneficial on for the growth and pigment synthesis ofSphingobacteriumsp. (Gierhart, 1994). It is thought that this corn steep liquor contains good amounts of amino acids and minerals necessary for the growth of these microorganisms. Without any special measurement taken, the fermentation ofSphingobacteriumsp. in glucose and corn steep liquor containing medium generates approximately 10 to 40 mg zeaxanthin per litre (Sajilata, Singhal & Kamat, 2008). Supplementation with palmitic esters, methionine, pyridoxine, ferrous salts, and reduction in temperature, have can increases the yield to 335 mg per litre.OxygenOxygen supply in the culture medium was found to be another important factor in the production of these microbial pigments (Gierhart, 1994). An increase in oxygen supply is generally correlated with an increase in the culture’s productivity. Oxygen is not only required for the growth ofSphingobacteriumsp. alone, but also for desaturation, cyclization and oxygenation of carotenoids (Sajilata, Singhal & Kamat, 2008). Zeaxanthin production can be improved by having a high oxygen transfer rate fermentor. The oxygen supply in the fermentor is effectively affected by two factors: agitation speed and aeration rate. The oxygen supply required by the growing culture can be adjusted by having a proper combination of these two factors.ReferencesAbro, A. H., Rahimi Shahmirzadi, M. R., Jasim, L.

Bacteria,"bacteria, public-health",The raw milk debate,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-raw-milk-debate/,"September 26, 2020","For many decades, since the later part of the 19th century in fact, debates have been intense about raw milk and its heat treatment and the pros and cons of it all.  Just to be clear that I’m not going to use any references in this article – with the voluminous amount of studies in the scientific literature on this topic, a huge literature review can easily be done, and I’m assuming many scholarly literatures have been written on this topic.  However, I’m choosing to not go down that path, rather write from my experience, my understanding and my perspective on this all-important topic, one that is almost continuously debated – yes, one hot topic indeed!  So, let’s get into it…First of all, a definition.  While the word “milk” has been used to refer to plant juice type products for many hundreds of years, in this case, I’m using the word milk to refer to the mammary gland secretion of adult female domesticated animals, most often bovine, but of course this various in different parts of the world.Cattle themselves, the pasture environment or indoor cattle accommodation in colder climates in winter along with the milking environment are certainly not the most hygienic places (Figure 1).  Animals, their faecal matter and mud is a combination that is certain to promote an unhygienic environment.  Thus, it is not surprising therefore that (raw) milk can and does harbour pathogenic micro-organisms (Figure 2) and milkborne disease was a significant public health issue.  Consequently, Louis Pasteur (Figure 3) is considered one of if not the most prominent scientist in the field of microbiology.  It is he who developed the preservation technique that bears his name – pasteurisation.  Originally developed for wine, it was applied to milk in an attempt reduce the terrible mortality and morbidity that came from drinking bovine milk raw, as was the case in those days.  I could write much about the history of pasteurisation, it’s introduction to the dairy industry and the debates in those early decades about how to protect public health yet provide a nutritious product.Figure 1: A dairy cattle farm shed.Figure 2: Some of the pathogenic bacteria that can be lurking in raw milk.Figure 3: Louis PasteurSo what are the two sides today?  Much the same really, it’s just that we have a different situation, scenario or norm now with most milk heat treated or otherwise processed for safety compared to a hundred years ago when most milk for human consumption was still raw, especially in the UK.  As a food microbiologist, my instant response regarding human consumption of raw milk is that it is always unsafe and should never be done, despite the many benefits that are claimed (Figure 4).  However, I read a review of a book (Figure 5) on Amazon recently which actually analysed such a response by a recent PhD graduate in his consumer-orientated book on food science questions.  While it is true that I would never drink raw milk myself (well, I never drink dairy milk at all anymore as I am now vegan), it is actually impossible to say if it is always unsafe.  The fact is, without microbiologically testing it, we just wouldn’t know.  Another fact is that pathogenic microorganisms are not that common, so the likelihood of their presence in a given sample of raw milk is very low – however, without testing that milk, they could be there, and all it takes are a few cells sometimes, or some temperature abuse perhaps, and you have an out of control population of pathogenic bacterial cells on the verge of causing disease in an unsuspecting raw milk drinker.  So while a given raw milk sample might be safe to drink, without testing it, we don’t know now.  Therefore, the risk can never be zero under such circumstances and therefore, raw milk must never be drunk unless there is an iron-clad guarantee as to is safety, which is pretty much impossible.Figure 4: Claimed benefits of drinking raw milk.Figure 5: The book (or more accurately a review of this book) which prompted me to write this blog article.It is true that heat treatment negatively impacts the nutritional quality of food, and milk too, but be aware of some people or groups making outrageous claims (Figure 5) that are incorrect.   The personal and public health consequences of raw milk consumption are just not worth the extra nutritional benefit from raw milk.  There are many safer food sources of those nutrients, or simply drink heat-processed milk, which will give you less of those nutrients, which you could make up from another source.Figure 6: Pasteurisation does not eliminate all nutrients in milk.Now, there’s another argument that raw milk advocates sometimes raise, especially if they have a dairy farm background, and it is that they or their family or friends have been drinking raw milk for years or for decades and never got sick.  Valid point, for sure.  This just shows the fact that pathogenic microorganisms are in fact rarely encountered.  Of course, the other possibility is that they did get ‘gastro’ and didn’t (or don’t want) attribute it to the raw milk.To sum up here – milk is indeed a highly nutritious food/drink.  Furthermore, there’s no denying the fact that heat treatment of raw milk, applied for safety reasons and to increase shelf-life, does have a detrimental effect on the nutritional quality.  My verdict is that because there is always a risk of foodborne disease from raw milk (unless one can guarantee it being free from microorganisms, which is impossible from a practical perspective), it should never be consumed.  There’s no point in taking an unnecessary risk.  Better to simply seek alternative dietary sources of those nutrients you are seeking from (raw) milk.I encourage challenge to my perspective, so let’s continue the debate in the comments section!","food microbiology, Food safety, foodborne disease, raw milk"
Bacteria,bacteria,Should Australia have cottage food laws?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/should-australia-have-cottage-food-laws/,"September 19, 2020","A really interesting question, but first of all, for those that are not familiar, what are cottage food laws and cottage food operators?  Cottage food operators, sometimes known as CFOs, are people legally conducting a food business from their place of residence, without any special modification to their food preparation and storage area.  The laws which govern such businesses are known as cottage food laws, and such laws operate in various states in the United States.  However in Australia, selling food prepared in a home kitchen is always illegal unless that kitchen has been approved by your local council for such purpose.  Should the situation change in Australia? what are the food safety risks? what are the benefits to the community and economically?First of all, perhaps consider that those jurisdictions that permit cottage food operators allow only certain foods to be sold, and these are low-risk foods that would not, under normal circumstances, post a food safety risk.  They do not require refrigeration and therefore cannot be temperature abused.  Surely this means they really do pose a very low food safety risk.  So what are some foods that are regarded as cottage foods?  Items like popcorn, dried pasta (Figure 1), biscuits, dried fruit are examples (Figures 2 and 3), and if you consider and think about these, you can imagine how they can’t go ‘off’ are can’t be safely kept at any temperature for an indefinite period of time without posing a food safety risk.  However, like many state-based laws in the US, many variations exist (Figure 4 andhttps://www.farmtoconsumer.org/cottage-foods-map/) – to what you can sell, the limit you can sell, where you can sell them and any requirements or criteria that the producers need to satisfy.  Some states even allow the sale of potentially hazardous foods, like meat products and cooked rice.  Now, it’s behind the scope of our consideration to go into aspects concerning the community and economic benefits, but suffice to say that I’m sure there would be such benefits.  However, our main concern here is if permitting sale of such non-potentially hazardous foods is too much of a risk to public health.  Might what is allowed pose a health risk, or might people abuse the privilege of cottage food laws and illegally sell potentially hazards food products?Figure 1: Pasta by Deb from Willaimsport, PA in the United States.Figure 2: Foods permitted under cottage food laws in the US state of Florida.Figure 3: Foods permitted under cottage food laws in the US state of Texas.Figure 4: Cottage food laws differ by state in the US.If we look at foods that are regarded as non-potentially hazardous, we can understand why they are low risk.  It’s because of one of more of the following: I) raw materials are low risk for either contamination potential or growth conditions should they become contaminated, II) preparation of that food product requires a heating step (for example baking) which effectively eliminates any potential pathogenic bacteria, III) the (intrinsic) conditions (such as pH and water activity – Figure 5) in the food make it inhospitable for contaminating microorganisms to survive and especially grow.  This essentially means that there are typically multiple barriers to the growth of microorganisms in the product and thus risk is negligible.  However is this good enough?  Despite all this, might there still be some way for cottage food producers to contaminate a product and provide conditions for the pathogenic microorganism to grow, resulting in foodborne disease, is this actually possible and how possible?  Well, if the results of Akinedenet al.(2015) are anything to go by, then the possibility may be higher than many think.  In this study, low but certainly not insignificant levels of microbial contamination was observed in many dried pasta samples in Germany – some of them had really quite high levels of total microorganisms present.  Furthermore, some samples did contain pathogenic bacteria –Staphylococcus aureus,various species ofCronobacterand even possiblyBacillus cereus.  Further adding to the concern of the potential for foodborne disease outbreaks to occur from dried food (food products with a water activity of 0.70 or lower) is the fact that there have been 41 reported outbreaks of foodborne disease worldwide between 1958 and 2017 (Chitrakeret al., 2019).  There have been quite a few outbreaks even involvingSalmonellaandBacillus cereustoo, along withCronobacter sakazakii(Figure 6), with the most common food products being powdered infant formula (14 outbreaks), dried meat (11 outbreaks) and spices (10 outbreaks).Figure 5: Food preservation classification of foods based on pH and water activity.Figure 6:Cronobacter sakazakiiSo, what do you make of all this?  Is Australia over-cautious or is the US too relaxed about this?  Really, it all comes down to the risk that a jurisdiction is willing to accept.  Clearly there is a risk from dried foods along, let alone all of the other many types of foods classified as not potentially hazardous.  Therefore, the US must be walling to accept the level of risk that foodborne disease might occur from cottage food products and consider the benefits (social, community, economic or others perhaps) of allowing cottage food production to be greater than the foodborne disease risks from such foods.  However in Australia, where governments tend to generally proceed more cautiously, any risk (of foodborne disease) is considered an unacceptable risk and therefore cottage food production is not permitted.What do you think about cottage food laws?ReferencesAkineden, Ö., Murata, K.

Bacteria,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Improving the survivability of probiotic bacteria,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/improving-the-survivability-of-probiotic-bacteria/,"September 9, 2020","This article is an extract from a literature review written by Louise Sidharta, a 3rd-year undergraduate student I was supervising at RMIT University in 2009.Introductory comments by Dr Philip Button.For probiotic bacteria to exert their positive effects, they need to survive many hostile (micro)environments before they reach the location in the gastrointestinal tract where they are needed.  Food processing conditions, temperate fluctuations during the post-manufacture supply chain, intrinsic conditions in the food and the gastrointestinal tract all provide challenges.  To deliver the maximum amount of probiotics right their site of action can pose a great challenge to food microbiologists – these are some of the strategies they can employ to ensure the highest percentage of survival.  Let’s now hear from Louise…Strain selectionAs mentioned previously, the ability to survive through the acid in the human stomach and bile in the intestine is one of the most important characteristics of probiotic bacteria. A number of studies on the survival ofL. acidophilus(Figure 1) andBifidobacteriumspp. in the presence of acid and bile salts have been carried out by several investigators (Conway, Gorbach, & Goldin, 1987; Gilliland, Staley, & Bush, 1984; Holcomb, Frank, & McGregor, 1991; Ibrahim & Bezkorovainy, 1993). Clark & Martin (1994) reported thatB. longumtolerated bile concentrations of as high as 4.0%, whereas Ibrahim & Bezkorovainy (1993) foundB. longumto be the least resistant to bile. Furthermore, three out of six CSIRO strains of lactobacilli showed the best survivability under acidic conditions and two strains showed the best tolerance to bile (Lankaputhra & Shah, 1995). Therefore, careful selection of strains on the basis of acid and bile tolerance would help improve the survivabilityensure the required minimum amount of probiotic bacteria in a given product.Figure 1:Lactobacillus acidophilusTwo-step fermentationThe composition of the yoghurt cultures participating in the fermentation has been suspected postulated to affect the survival ofL. acidophilusandBifidobacteriumspp., causing their severe viability losses during storage (Shah, 2000). Inhibitory substances such as acid and hydrogen peroxide produced by yoghurt cultures are the major cause of this problem, as explained by Hull, Roberts, & Mayes (1984). Nevertheless, these cultures are prerequisite in yoghurt manufacture as they are responsible for the typical yoghurt flavour. Lankaputhra & Shah (1997) suggested two-stage fermentation as means of improving the viability of probiotic bacteria. Results from this study showed that fermentation with probiotic bacteria followed by fermentation with yoghurt cultures brings a significant increase in the initial and final counts of probiotic bacteria. The initial counts have been found to increase by 4 to 5 times and the final counts ofL. acidophilus2409 andB. longum1941 following 6 weeks of storage were 6.85 and 7.93 log cfu/g and 7.60 and 8.84 cfu/g for yoghurt prepared by single and two-stage fermentation, respectively.Oxygen impermeable packagingL. acidophilusis microaerophilic andBifidobacteriumspp. are strictly anaerobic. Oxygen affects the probiotic cultures in two ways; by direct or indirect toxicity to cells (Dave & Shah, 1997). Direct toxicity is presumably due to the intracellular production of hydrogen peroxide, while indirect toxicity is caused by the production of hydrogen peroxide by other cultures in the environment such asL. delbrueckii(Villegas & Gilliland, 1998). One way to prevent the detrimental effects of oxygen on the probiotic cultures is through the use of oxygen-impermeable packaging. Dave & Shah (1997) reported a higher increase in numbers and survival ofL. acidophilusduring storage in yoghurts made in plastic containers rather than glass. Bifidobacteria showed higher survival in glass bottles than in plastic cups. To be exact, the initial counts of the bifidobacteria population were 1.6 fold higher in yoghurt prepared in glass bottles than plastic cups, although the acid contents were similar in both samples. Klaveret al. (1993) observed better survival and viability of bifidobacteria in deaerated milk.MicroencapsulationMicroencapsulation technology has been under special consideration and investigation as an effective approach to enhance the survival rate of probiotic bacteria in acidic products (Figure 2) such as dairy fermented products (Kailasapathy, 2002; Krasaekoopt, Bhandari, & Deeth, 2003). Shahidi & Han (1993) define microencapsulation as “a technology of packaging solids, liquid or gaseous materials in miniature, sealed capsules that can release their contents at controlled rates under the influence of specific conditions”. Another definition from a microbiological point of view defines microencapsulation as “the process of entrapment/enclosure of microbial cells by means of coating them with proper hydrocolloid(s) in order to segregate the cells from the surrounding environment; in a way that results in appropriate cell release in the intestinal medium” (Sultanaet al., 2000; Krasaekooptet al., 2003; Picot & Lacroix, 2003).  Microencapsulation has been shown to protect the probiotic bacterial cells against the influences of adverse environmental factors such as high acidity and low pH (Sun & Griffiths, 2000), bile salts (Lee & Heo, 2000), cold shocks caused by deep freezing and freeze drying (Shah & Ravula, 2000), molecular oxygen in case of strictly anaerobic microorganisms likeBifidobacteriumspp. (Sunoharaet al., 1995), and heat shocks caused by spray drying (Steensonet al., 1987). According to Anal & Singh (2007), the most commonly used encapsulant materials in microencapsulation are food-grade polymers such as alginate, chitosan, κ-carrageenan and gelatin.Figure 2: How microencapsulation can help probiotic survival.ReferencesAnal, A.

A few weeks ago, I started moving our video content to our new Brand YouTube channel, with the first (and so far the only!) video on our channel being  on my career in food microbiology.  In fact, this video formed the basis of our vlog posted on May 24, which is located here:http://foodmicrobiology.academy/2020/05/24/my-food-microbiology-career/.So anyway, a few days ago my video was found by a (very) young aspiring food microbiologist in Mumbai, India.  This teenage student made some comments to initiate a conversation with my around career advice and guidance, then we continue our discussions through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.  Now, we’re about to formalise our discussions with a mentoring agreement.  This is just great news and of mutual benefit as she can clearly gain from my years on a non-traditional career path and I real feel like I’m ‘giving back’ and encouraging and ‘grooming’ the next generation of passionate food microbiologists to come along and really take on the challenges of the world and solve them, which we can all really achieve together.  This student is pretty amazing because even at her young age, she has a career vision and a firm goal of wanting to work in the area of food safety and foodborne diseases at the World Health Organization.  With such a plan at such an early age, she can so get there as well.  What I wanted this blog post to be was to introduce the career mentoring thatFood Microbiology Academynow offers by elaborating on some of the examples I provided to this mentee during our early discussions.Firstly, too many people, myself included years ago in the mid to late 1990s, have a general career idea but no firm goal and vision.  Without this, you do almost wander aimlessly to some extent.  Thus, I would say – don’t worry about or try and identify what you will study as your undergraduate degree and where until you have identified your dream job.  Then, you can work backwards.  Setting your dream job as your goal will help answer so many questions, such as:Which is the highest degree I’ll need?Do I need to do a Master degree?  if so, should it be a research or coursework Master degree?Which country should I complete my various degrees in?What should my undergraduate degree be in?What sort of opportunities should I seek during holidays or internships to support me reaching my career goal(s)?For example, if you have come to the conclusion that you need a PhD, does the Australian (three years, one laboratory, research only) or North American (four years, laboratory rotations during the first year, 25% coursework) model work better for you and your career.  Then, for training like a PhD, the importance of factors that you should consider can be ranked like this, from most important to least important: Supervisor > Laboratory > Department > University > Country.  Some people get to hung up over doing their PhD in a particular country or a particular university.  However, it is the supervisor that is most critical and I’m sure you can find exceptional academic supervisors leading world-class research groups engaging in cutting edge discoveries located in what many would consider sub-standard universities or lower ranking countries for research training or higher education in general.However, you may not even be at the stage where you can identify your ideal or dream job, but you just have a hankering for food microbiology.  In such case, perhaps consider the following, as a non-exhaustive list of careers in food microbiology that require high levels of responsibility, so senior positions that typical require a PhD:I)Teaching food microbiology in a college/university(professor in a community college).II)Doing food safety research in a university(research-only academic position, like Research Assistant Professor or Senior Research Fellow, in a research-intensive university).III)Teaching food microbiology and doing food safety research in a university(traditional academic position).IV)Doing food safety research and development in a food manufacturing company(only food manufacturing companies of substantial size, like Nestlé would engage in such R&D)V)Consulting and therefore providing advice to small and medium size food companies on keeping their products safe(either as an independent consultant or working for a scientific consulting firm).VI)Managing food safety at a large food manufacturing company(this may be part of a quality management role of if the food manufacturing operation is large enough, then it would be a seperate position).VII)Tracking foodborne diseases and identifying sources of outbreaks(such as at a government health organisation, which could be at a national level like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States or the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory in the Australian state of Victoria)VIII)Developing public health strategies and government policy to reduce foodborne disease(an advisory role in government to assemble scientific information and make recommendations for policy and legislative changes to protect the health of the citizens under the jurisdiction of the government you’re working for).So, if you’re a budding food microbiologist (no pun intended!) or simply want to find out more about careers and working in our field, do contact myself (Dr Philip Button, @pdbutton, by e-mail to philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academy).","career, career choice, food microbiologist, mentoring"
Bacteria,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, viruses",Where to obtain maximum probiotic benefits.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/where-to-obtain-maximum-probiotic-benefits/,"August 4, 2020","Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, “immune system” has been a buzzword around us! Recovery from this disease in most cases has largely been reliant on the human body’s natural defence, the immune system. A whopping 70% of our immune system activity is located in our gut. Bacteria in the intestine may help regulate immune cell activity, which allows probiotics to be potentially helpful for supporting immune function. Clinical evidence shows that certain probiotic strains help to prevent bacterial and viral infections, including gastroenteritis, sepsis, and respiratory tract infections.What are probiotics ?Probiotics are “live microorganisms  when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.” The concept of probiotic bacteria is very old, and is associated with the consumption of fermented foods by human beings, for thousands of years. Recently, new types of food products containing probiotic bacteria have started to be introduced into the market, including non-dairy products, such as chocolate, cereals, beverages, fruits and vegetables products. In the near future, a wide range of non-traditional food products containing probiotic bacteria are expected to be introduced into the market.How Probiotics Act ?As mentioned in an earlier blog article, probiotics have various mechanisms of action. Probiotic microorganisms can be elucidated by promotion of digestion and uptake of dietary nutrients, strengthening of intestinal barrier function, modulation of the innate and acquired immune response of the host, production of antimicrobial substances and competition with pathogens for binding sites. In addition probiotics show adhesion and colonization of the different sites of the human body which may increase their retention time thus providing prolonged probiotic activity.Probiotics  produce substances that inhibit pathogens – low-molecular weight substances – bacteriocins, antibiotics and microcins. Lactic acid bacteria produce a variety of substances that exhibit antagonistic activity against other bacteria.Various Probiotic ProductsDairy probiotic products:-Milk is an excellent medium to carry or generate live and active probiotics through various cultured dairy products. The buffering capacity of milk helps to improve the survival of probiotic flora in the GI tract. Currently hundreds of probiotic dairy products are manufactured and consumed around the world, examples are as follows.Yoghurt– About 80% of the population use yoghurt for direct consumption or as a food supplement daily. A characteristic feature of this product is the addition of starters of pure cultures ofStreptococcus thermophilusandLactobacillus delbrueckiissp.Bulgaricusfor conducting lactic acid fermentation.  These traditional lactic acid bacteria have a positive effect on the body, which is a result of the formed metabolites, which inhibit the putrefactive and pathogenic flora or of the improvement of the utilization of lactose. In last decade many new flavours have been incorporated in yoghurts in order to attract consumers.Ice cream– The incorporation of probiotic cultures into ice cream results in adding value to the ice cream product and it being considered as a functional product. The ice cream composition, which includes milk, incorporating proteins, fat and lactose, as well as other compounds, make ice cream a good vehicle for probiotic cultures. During probiotic ice cream development, the ultimate aim of processes optimization is to enhance and maintain the probiotic survivability, ice cream being relatively high in pH at values of 5.5 to 6.5 leads to an increased survival of the probiotic bacteria upon storage.Cheese– Cheese provides a valuable alternative as a food vehicle for probiotic delivery. Its high protein content provides probiotic bacteria with a good buffering protection against the high acidic condition in the gastrointestinal tract, and thus enhances probiotic bacterial survival throughout gastric transit. Cheddar cheese is a good carrier to deliverEnterococcus faeciuminto the gastrointestinal tract of humans.Kefir– Kefir is a traditional popular beverage consumed for thousands of years in the Central Asia and Middle East countries. It is an acidic-alcoholic fermented milk product, with uniform creamy consistency and a slight sour taste. Milk is fermented with kefir grains, it usually contain lactose-fermenting yeastsKluyveromyces lactis, K. marxianusandTorula kefir.Lactobacillus, Lactococcus,andLeuconostoc; acetic acid bacteria and a further yeast mixture are typical inclusions. Kefir is rich in vitamins B1, B12, folic acid, vitamin K, and biotin, as well as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.Non-dairy probiotic productsDairy products are the main food carriers for probiotic bacteria to human. Limitations of these products such as the presence of allergens, high lactose and cholesterol contents, and the requirement for cold storage facilities have created the need to look for new probiotic product lines based on non-dairy substrates. Several ranges of non-dairy probiotic products have been developed and marketed in the last two decades.Chocolate– The application of probiotic bacteria into chocolate could offer a good alternative to common dairy products, and allow for broadening the health claims of chocolate-based food products. A chocolate mousse was developed by using probiotic and prebiotic ingredients withL. paracaseisubspecies and with the prebiotic ingredient inulin.Soy based products–  Soybeans are typically high in phytic acid, a plant compound that impairs the absorption of minerals like iron and zinc. Fermentation lowers the amount of phytic acid, which may increase the amount of minerals your body is able to absorb from tempeh and other products. It includes the following products:-Miso–  It is made by mixing soybeans with other ingredients, such as barley, rice and rye. Miso is a good source of protein, fiber and various vitamins, minerals and plant compounds, including vitamin K, manganese and copper.Natto– Natto is a fermented soy product that is a staple in Japanese kitchens. It contains a high amount of vitamin K2, which may help prevent osteoporosis and heart attacks.Tempeh– Tempeh serves as a popular, high-protein substitute for meat. It contains a decent amount of vitamin B12, a nutrient found mainly in animal products.Kombucha– It’s made by adding specific strains of bacteria, yeast and sugar to black or green tea, then allowing it to ferment for a week or more. Kombucha is rich in tea polyphenols and acetic acid, which have both been shown to suppress the growth of undesirable bacteria and yeasts as well as helped prevent the growth and spread of cancerous cells. In the market Kombucha is now available in several fruit flavours.Sourdough Bread– It is an old popular bread which has recently risen to popularity! A recent study showed the market value of sourdough increased from $298.7 million in 2014 to $2.4 billion in 2018. Sourdough bread may not seem that different from regular bread, however the fermentation process breaks down some of the gluten, and that makes it more digestible, especially for people who struggle to digest gluten.

1998).  Once the problem of aseptic filling had been addressed (Zadow, 1975), commercial UHT processing commenced in Australia around 1964 (Zadow, 1993a; 1998).  This followed research and development around the world on aseptic processing since around the 1870s (Hostettler, 1972a).  Two variations of UHT treatment are in use: direct (Figure 1) and indirect (Figure 2).  A detailed description of these two techniques is provided by Dattaet al.(2002) who also cover effects on milk while Jelen (1982) discusses both direct and indirect techniques from various perspectives of industrial relevance.  The basis of the direct heating system is the direct mixing of steam with milk.  This can be achieved in one of two ways: either steam injection, where steam is injected into the milk or steam infusion, in which milk enters an infusion chamber containing superheated steam.  Indirect UHT treatment occurs when milk is heated by contact with steam or superheated water across the metal surface of a heat exchanger.Figure 1: Direct UHT processing.The major difference between the two forms of UHT treatment is the temperature profile during treatment (Figure 3), as outlined by Zadow (1986).  Direct UHT treatment is less severe because an almost instantaneous rise and fall in temperature takes place with the milk held at a temperature between 70 and 80 °C for 70 seconds.  In comparison, the increase and decrease in temperature in milk heated indirectly is considerably more gradual, therefore temperatures are elevated for a longer period, at or above 70 °C for 120 seconds and at or above 100 °C for 70 seconds.  Severity of indirect heating is reflected by the degree of denaturation of whey proteins.Dattaet al.(2002), who reviewed this topic, found substantial quantities of undenatured β-LG remaining in UHT milk that was treated by the direct method compared to the minimal amount typically seen in milk following indirect UHT treatment.  These more recent results were not too different from the work of Zadow (1969) who observed more than twice the amount of β-LG denatured in UHT milk processed indirectly compared to that directly treated.Figure 3: Temperature profile comparison of direct and indirect UHT processing.A myriad of nutritional and organoleptic changes have been observed in milk following UHT processing, some of which are unique to this product (Niroumand, 1977).  Changes to proteins induced by ultra high temperature (UHT) processing can be detrimental to stability of UHT milk products.  This is primarily due to formation of a complex between β-LG and the micelle surface proteins (predominately with κ-CN), in addition to interaction of β-LG with α-LA, which all occur at even moderate temperatures (Fairiseet al., 1999), even as low as 80 ºC (Choet al., 2003).  Pasteurisation (Figure 4) is the most widely used heat processing method for raw milk, leading to reduction in numbers of spoilage bacteria and elimination of pathogenic bacteria.  Higher temperatures (between 135 and 150 °C) can be applied for a (usually) shorter duration (between two and 20 sec) (Ahrné, 1988), for more effective control of bacterial contaminants.  This form of heat processing is ultra high temperature (UHT) treatment which provides a very long shelf life, compared to pasteurised milk, even when stored at ambient temperatures.  Such processing conditions give “commercial sterility”.  This aspect is discussed by Luck (1975) and Zadow (1980) and implies that, theoretically, all microorganisms have been eliminated, but in practice this is not attainable and therefore commercial sterility is a measure of the failure rate (Dentener, 1986).  Dentener (1986) also explains that processors usually strive for failure rate of no more than one in 5000.Figure 4: Comparison of heat treamtne to milk by pasteurisation and UHT processing.Mesophilic, psychrotrophic and psychrophilic microorganisms (Figure 5) are usually eliminated during UHT treatment; heat resistance enabling survival of these microorganisms is extremely unusual.  However, spoilage is possible through the presence of mesophilic organisms in the finished product, which can also occur through contamination of the sterile product during filling  For example, there is an isolated report of UHT milk spoilage due to growth ofEnterobactersp. andMicrococcussp., which demonstrated remarkably high levels of heat resistance (Antoine & Donawa, 1990).  It is possible that in this particular case time/temperature combination typical of the UHT process was not achieved.  In some countries, contamination of UHT milk does appear to be a major problem.  For example, in Egypt, some samples of UHT milk had a total bacterial count of up to 105cfu/mL (El-Samragyet al., 1992).Figure 5: Microbial growth temperatures.Due to the heat treatment conditions typical of UHT processing, thermophilic and thermoduric microflora or their spores are most often responsible for contamination of UHT milk (Foschinoet al., 1990; Lewis, 1999).  Although these bacteria are present in freshly drawn raw milk in low numbers (Flintet al., 2001), they may be present in long-life dairy products (Westhoff & Dougherty, 1981), and are very important owing to their potential involvement in spoilage of those products, which has been recognised for a long time (Grinstead & Clegg, 1955).Bacillus sporothermoduranshas been one of the most frequently implicated (Klijnet al., 1997).  As a result of the extreme heat resistance of its spores (Huemeret al., 1998), which may lead to the possibility of spore survival during UHT processing and subsequent germination in UHT milk (Petterssonet al., 1996), it can be regarded as one of the most important.  Also, high levels ofGeobacillus stearothermophilusvegetative cells (Figure 6) may cause flat sour spoilage (Figure 7) of low-acid foods, including milk (Ito, 1981), especially evaporated milk (Kalogridou-Vassiliadouet al., 1989).  It is not unreasonable to expect one in 100 000 1 L packs of UHT milk to be contaminated with thermophilic or thermoduric bacteria, which is considered acceptable (Luck, 1975), although a total count of 102cfu/mL after 15 d at 30 ºC also seems to be acceptable for UHT milk (Lewis, 1999), which would appear odd as this does seem significant contamination.  Although many factors can be influential, the single most important factor in ensuring commercial sterility is a strict maintenance schedule (Farahnik, 1982).Source: https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/874030/view/geobacillus-stearothermophilus-semFigure 6: Transmission electron micrograph ofGeobacillus stearothermophilus.Figure 7: Definition of flat sour spoilage.

Bacteria,bacteria,Microbiological safety of rice dumplings.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/microbiological-safety-of-rice-dumplings/,"June 18, 2020","Next week, on June 25, is an important Chinese-based cultural occasion, known as 端午节, or in English as the Dragon Boat Festival or Rice Dumpling Festival.  It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, and is celebrated annually.  What has this got to do with food microbiology you may be thinking … well, one of the main and most important traditions associated with this festival is eating 粽子 (Figure 1), known in English as rice dumplings, hence one of the English names for 端午 being Rice Dumpling Festival.  Rice is to be considered as much of a food safety hazard as meat is, because of the potential for contamination with vegetative cells of spore forming Gram positive bacteria, spore germination and growth , and the resulting intoxication.  Thus, for those who follow a vegan or vegetarian diet, rice would be the number one food safety concern.  Let us explore this food safety concern (how it occurs, why it occurs and more) and how you can stay safe this Rice Dumpling Festival.Figure 1: Typical 粽子, or zongi (rice dumplings).Rice dumplings are a sticky, glutinous rice snack also containing some meat or vegetables.  While the meat component has its own food safety risks, in this blog article I wanted to focus on rice safety, since these are a rice-based food item.  From personal observation, a concerning aspect of the handling of rice dumplings during storage and distribution is the temperature abuse they are subject to.  For example, Eastern Rice Dumpling, a Singapore-located rice dumpling manufacturer states on their website (http://dongyuan.com.sg/index.php?route=news/article&news_id=10) “…when dumplings are placed in the refrigerator within 24 hours purchase, they can be kept for up to five days”.  So, what temperature are they kept at during that first 24 hours?  At ambient temperature, in Singapore’s tropical heat?  I cringe when thinking what the assumed storage temperature is during this period!So, here’s the what and how of why rice dumplings, or indeed any rice dish (Mortimeret al., 1974), is a foodborne disease hazard.  Uncooked rice may contain spores ofBacillus cereus(Figure 2).  This is a Gram positive, spore-forming, facultative anaerobic  rod shaped bacterium (Figure 3) that is not uncommon in the environment and food.  Once the rice has been cooked, the spores may germinate.  If there are indeed spores present, and they have germinated, they longer the rice dish remains in the temperature danger zone (between 5 °C / 40 °F and 60 °C / 140 °F), the greater the chance the spores will germinate and the vegetative cells will grow to dangerous levels.  If they do, they will produce an emetic toxin (called cereulide), such that a vomiting-based intoxication can result.  Production of this toxin has been shown to take place at a temperature no lower than 15 °C (Finlayet al., 2002), which could be considered under temperature abuse considerations.  This means that if the food is held below 15 °C, the bacteria will grow, but not produce toxin, thus an emetic intoxication will not result.  Other type of foodborne disease could occur, but it is unlikely to be emetic.  Granum and Lund (1997) have compiled a nice table summarising this disease – ingestion of the performed peptide ring toxin in food can result in vomiting, nausea and malaise within a half hour to five hours after ingestion, with the symptoms lasting for between six and 24 hours.  In addition to rice, they state that pasta, pastries and noodles may also be implicated foods.Figure 2: Summary ofBacillus cereusfoodborne disease.Figure 3:Bacillus cereus.How can you protect yourself and your loved ones from this emetic intoxication?  The Centre for Food Safety in Hong Kong (https://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/whatsnew/whatsnew_sfst/whatsnew_sfst_tips_for_enjoying_glutinous_rice_dumplings_safely.html) has some tips which are spot on for minimising your chance of succumbing to a foodborne disease episode.  They are:Buy glutinous rice dumplings from reliable retail outlets and don’t patronise illegal hawkers*.Choose rice dumplings that are securely wrapped in wrapping leaves.Store the rice dumplings in the refrigerator at or below 4 °C.Consume the purchased rice dumplings as soon as possible and avoid prolonged storage.Reheat the rice dumplings thoroughly for at least 15 minutes with the centre temperature at 75 °Cbefore consumption.Discard all leftover rice dumplings if they have been left at room temperature for more than two hours.* In Australia, or indeed any country, this would also mean, do not buy rice dumplings from people making them at home, unless you can be sure they are making them in a council approved commercial kitchen.  Retail outlets are the best option, as rice dumplings manufactured in such an environment are almost certain to pass all chemical and microbiological safety tests, as this survey in Hong Kong demonstrated in 2013 (https://hongkongbusiness.hk/food-beverage/more-news/rice-dumplings-pass-food-safety-tests?page=5&utm_source=reasonable&utm_medium=edm&utm_campaign=%5BCAMPAIGN_NAME%5D).  If you are purchasing from a non-retail outlet, ask the person making or selling them to show you verification of the council’s approval of their preparation and manufacturing space.  This is especially important during this COVID-19 pandemic period when illegal sellers of homemade food have proliferated.  These people are unlikely to have the appropriate level of knowledge to minimise or eliminate food safety risks, because if they did, they wouldn’t be selling food prepared and manufactured in a non-approved space.  Play it safe, and don’t put you and your loved ones at risk of this intoxication illness.The points above are key to a safe and healthy Rice Dumpling Festival.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",My food microbiology career,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/my-food-microbiology-career/,"May 24, 2020","Here I venture into a combination approach, with traditional text and video in this first vlog post, covering my career as a food microbiologist.I’m doing a bit of a focus on careers in food microbiology, with my last blog article on this topic and now this one, where I combining the written blog approach with the vlog approach.  My previous blog post introduced the prominence and significance of microbiologists in the world, and thus as a career, before a short description of the areas of food safety, food spoilage/quality and gut health/probiotics and fermented foods.  I then detailed a career Q&A with a food safety auditor from Taipei.  In this video, I ask myself the same questions and show the path I’ve taken to become a food microbiologist.What I didn’t mention is that in 1994, while I was starting my Bachelor degree-level training in biology at Deakin University, I completed a vocational certificate-level course in horticulture, at the then Townsville College of TAFE.  So I’m a qualified horticulturist as well!However, I started as a microbiologist, with my initial training in that area being clinical microbiology with a veterinary emphasis before I gravitated to the wonders of food microbiology in the 3rd-year of my undergraduate degree at James Cook University.  I then continued in food microbiology – working on inducible acid tolerance of foodborne disease bacteria (in salad dressing and yogurt) for my Honours research at the then University of Ballarat, bacterial iron acquisition systems which enable them to spoil refrigerated pork exported to Asian markets for my MSc research at La Trobe University and for my PhD at The University of Melbourne and CSIRO, I investigated aspects of dairy product quality.  Specifically, I characterised the spoilage process of UHT milk with regard to the free amino acids and peptides that are liberated along with free fatty acids, as a result of the residual proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes that remain in the product following UHT treatment (2-4 seconds and around 140 degrees C).  I refined existing protease assays, increasing their sensitivity such that they could be used to better predict the onset of enzymatic-based spoilage in UHT milk.  Essentially therefore, my PhD project was in the area of biochemistry, specifically in enzymology and protein chemistry.For my postdoctoral work, I went to RMIT University where I worked in the Kasapis laboratory, gaining valuable research understanding and technical technical skills in the broad areas of physical chemistry and materials science, especially in relation to the use of carbohydrate polymers and protein in food systems and understanding how application of physical parameters may alter their molecular properties, thus altering their texture, mouthfeel and how they behave as ingredients in food products.  I was primarily using techniques of rheology and (differential scanning) calorimetry.  Following my postdoctoral position, I moved within RMIT University from what was then the School of Applied Sciences to the School of Business IT and Logistics where I contributed to projects in food composition databases, e-commerce and related areas of improving the consumer customer through innovative retailing solutions.Now, as an independent and freelance food microbiologist, I operate my own non-affiliated organisation called Food Microbiology Academy.  I offer services in consulting to the food manufacturing industry worldwide (both to start-ups and established food manufacturing enterprises), academic support (tutoring, research services, teaching) as well as contract and collaborative research – all of these primarily in my core expertise areas of food safety, food spoilage, food preservation and shelf-life extension.","career choice, food microbiologist, food microbiology, food science"

Therefore, there’s no doubt that microbiologists are particularly valuable at the moment.  Especially virologists and those microbiologists that have an understanding of infectious diseases, public health and/or epidemiology.  Plus, some knowledge of immunology can be helpful to for vaccine development as can pharmacology for drug development.  However, it’s really the microbiologists that are coming to the fore.  People talk about ‘saving the world’ and about the impact and importance of careers, but microbiologists really can save the world.  If you had any doubt about the importance of a career in microbiology, then just consider what is happening in the world now and what has happened since December.  …and we’re not just talking about personal and public health, but livelihoods and the global economy.  The economy has gone ‘pear-shaped’ because of a microbiological phenomenon, something that could be stopped by microbiologists, if they are, or were given the opportunity.  The power is in the hands of microbiologists and those with an intricate understanding of microbiology, to save the world, I have no doubt about that.  So, if you want a powerful career, an impactful career, a highly significant career, then consider microbiology!A FOOD MICROBIOLOGY CAREERHow about a career in food microbiology?  What might that look like and what might one be involved with?  Well even in food microbiology there are many varied areas to work in.  The three key areas are: i) food safety, ii) food spoilage/food quality and iii) fermented foods, probiotics and gut health.  Each of these has highly significant impacts on society and on the economy.  Let’s look at each of these in more detail.What is food safety?Food safety is all about ensuring the safety of the food supply.  This means monitoring, auditing, regulating and developing policy for the purposes of safeguarding raw materials and manufactured food over the entire agrifood supply chain from ‘farm to fork’ or ‘paddock to plate’ as the concept goes.  Food safety microbiologists closely associate with epidemiologists, public health professionals and infectious disease experts to combat prevention, tracking and limiting the spread of foodborne diseases of epidemic proportions.What is food spoilage and food quality?Spoilage and subsequent wastage of food results in substantial economic losses.  In countries with developing economies, such spoilage and waste of food is more likely to be fresh produce and thus postharvest and pre-manufacure losses.  In countries with advanced economies, the situation is quite different, with substantial spoilage and waste taking place at the consumer level.  Tight supply chains along with excellent mechanisms of food preservation mean that spoilage losses in such countries are at a minimum.What are fermented foods, probiotics and gut health?This area is closely linked with personal health and wellness.  There is a sustained food trend in the area of probiotics as functional foods, along with prebiotics and people realise the great benefits of how one’s gut health contributes to overall health and wellbeing.  Related to this are fermented foods, many of which are probiotic, and as such, are rich natural sources of ‘good’ bacteria.CAREER PROFILE OF A FOOD MICROBIOLOGISTWondering how a career in food microbiology might actually look like in reality?  Well, I had a Q & A session with Lucy Lam, a food safety auditor from Taipei, Taiwan.  Let’s find out what Lucy’s food microbiology career looks like…What qualification(s) do you hold and from where?Master of Science, with a major in food, nutrition and technology, from The Chinese University of Hong KongBachelor of Food Science, from The University of MelbourneYour present position and where?Auditor, Bureau Veritas Certification  (Taiwan)How would you describe your career ‘in a nutshell’?A passion for food safety and quality control along with being good at problem solving. 1. Interest in manufacturing in any field, especially the food industry 2. Looking forward to opportunities to be involved more in food product development.Describe what you do you do on a day-to-day basis?As an auditor, I follow back office schedules to visit clients and conduct on-site audit. Before and after the audit, preparation of the report document is needed.How do you gain most satisfaction in your food microbiology career?When I gained the most hands-on experience in food microbiology when I was working in the food industry between 2013 – 2018. As I was a laboratory supervisor and department assistant manager, I had to oversee the operation of the laboratory including lab supplies, SOPs, good laboratory practices and third party laboratory compliances.What can you forsee as big challenges in your particular area of food microbiology?Food microbiology testing can be regarded as a quality control gate for product release and assurance in food industry. Hence the testing lead time will be demanding and tends to be “quick and accurate”. It is believed that rapid test kits or rapid test methods will be upcoming trends in food microbiology testing.Some advice about a career in food microbiology?It is suggested people who wish to be a food microbiologist must have basic food knowledge, and willing to do a lot of research and study.So there you have it, whether it’s building the health of individuals through improving gut health, ensuring public health is maintained through a safe food supply or curbing the substantial economic losses through food spoilage and food waste, there are multiple ways to save the world as a food microbiologist!

Bacteria,bacteria,Get to know … Staphylococcus aureus.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/get-to-know-staphylococcus-aureus/,"April 28, 2020","What do you know aboutStaphylococcus aureus?  It’s one of the most common causes of foodborne disease, but is not the most commonly reported, why?  This Gram positive coccus (Figure 1) generally results in a relatively mild and self-limiting disease with fatalities extremely rare.  However, it still sickens many and impacts on the economy due to absences from work and occasional hospitalisations.  Let’s find out more about this pathogen…Figure 1: Gram stain ofStaphylococcus aureus.What are their preferred growth conditions?The optimal growth conditions forS. aureusare as follows: Temperature between 30°C and 37°C, water activity between 0.94 and 0.99, pH slightly alkaline in the range of 7.0 to 7.5, and an aerobic atmosphere.  They are also very salt tolerant, even more soVibriospp. which thrive in the seas and oceans of the world.S. aureuscan tolerate an NaCl concentration as high as 15%, and in fact this is exploited in its isolation, for example with Mannitol Salt Agar (MSA) (Figure 2).  MSA is a selective medium for staphylococci due to the incorporation of 7.5% NaCl, which ensures almost nothing else is capable of growing.  Due to its salt tolerance,S. aureusis not an uncommon human skin commensal, which contributes to the ease of its transfer onto food, from food handlers.  Not infected food handlers, because various species of staphylococci can be found in/on various human body locations as a normal part of the microbiome.Figure 2: Growth of three Gram positive bacteria on Mannitol Salt Agar.What is the pathogenesis of staphylococcal intoxication?S. aureusproduces enterotoxins.  Their toxins (plus some produced byStreptococcus pyogenes) are collectively termed pyogenic toxins and act as super antigens.  Unless a substantial dose of the toxin is ingested, their sit of action is localised in the abdominal viscera.  In the abdomen, the toxin stimulates neural receptions, which then transmits impulses to the medullary emetic centre via the vagus and sympathetic nerves (Figure 3).  Once the emetic centre is stimulated, vomiting results.Figure 3: Pathogenesis of staphylococcal intoxication.What is the clinical presentation of staphylococcal intoxication?A patient diagnosed with staphylococcal foodborne disease usually presents with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal cramps which vary insecurity.  While the symptoms are not long-lasting, with recovery typically taking place between 24 and 72 hours after the onset of symptoms, onset is rapid, since this disease is an intoxication.  Symptoms are often seen around six hours after ingestion of the offending food item.Mode of transmissionS. aureusis commonly found on human skin, such as hands.  Since so many people carry this microorganism on their hands, this is one of the most likely ways for an outbreak to start.  Nasal carriage is also common.  In fact, nasal carriage is so common that analysing nasal carriage rates amongst university students is a favourite introductory activity in introductory microbiology laboratory classes.  So, a typical example of transmission could run like this: A food handler carrying this bacterium is preparing food with barehands.  The bacteria are transferred to the food during the preparation of the food for cooking.  During this stage, when the bacteria are in the food, they grow and produce enterotoxins if the food is subjected to temperature abuse which would give the bacteria sufficient time to grow.  The food is then cooked, which eliminates the bacteria, bu t not the extremely heat-resistant toxin, which can retained activity following standard cooking procedures.  Believing the food to be safe for consumption after a normal cooking time and temperature, then food is served and consumed.  Since the toxin remains in the food, intoxication results once the food is consumed, with onset symptoms typically seen in around six hours.  Milk, cream sweets/cakes (Figure 4) and salty foods like ham are most often implicated.Figure 4: Cream-filled sweets are of particular concern for staphylococcal intoxication.What toxins are produced byS. aureus?This species produces nine enterotoxins, designated A, B (Figure 5), C1, C2, C3, D, E, G and H.  It would appear that enterotoxin A is probably respondislb for most staphylococcal intoxications.  This has been the finding in a number of studies which isolated toxins from isolates which had been implicated in outbreaks of staphylococcal foodborne disease.Figure 5: Structure of Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B.There are some staphylococcal outbreaks from high acid/low pH foods.  How is this possible? Doesn’t the harsh acidic conditions eliminate the vegetative cells?S. aureusis one of various bacterial species that are able to induce an acid tolerant state.  This means that when the cells are subjected to a sub-lethal pH value, for example 5.0, they can adapt to acidic conditions sufficiently so that they can then survive at a much lower pH value, say 3.0, which would normally prove lethal.  This has major implications for the food industry and for public health – take this example: A particular food that has a pH of around 5.0 is contaminated with cells ofS. aureus.  After exposure to this pH, and it doesn’t take long, maybe 15 or 30 minutes is all it takes, the cells become adapted to acidic conditions.  The cells may not grow, but will remain viable in this pH 5.0 food.  Then, when someone consumes the food (and theS. aureuscells), it is ingested and passes through the gastrointestinal tract (Figure 6).  Once reaching the stomach, the pH of which is normally a lethal barrier to invading pathogenic microorganisms, the cells are able to survive and may result in disease at some point along the gastrointestinal tract.  Even if they don’t, they could be shed in faeces as viable cells.  This adaptation, forS. aureus, can take place in either inorganic or organic acid, which makes this circumstance of particular concern for the food manufacturing industry.Figure 6: The pH at various points along the human gastrointestinal tract.","bacteriology, clinical microbiology, food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, microbiology"

We’ve teamed up to share our understanding of the food product development process to assist accomplished home cooks, home cooks that have an idea that they may want to pursue commercialisation of a much-loved home cooked dish.  Dr Timilsena has contributed the section on the practice of food product development, whereas I have written on the principles of food product development.Figure 1: The front cover of my forthcoming book.For an insight into our soon to be released forthcoming joint publication, I’ve provided the below text below, which is an extract from the book.

This section of the book gives an idea of the shelf-life considerations of a new product, as they relate to food spoilage – the next section, 3.4, is about HACCP and food safety.To launch our book, we’ll be having a book launch event (Figure 2) on Sunday 26 April 2020 at 04:00 UTC, that’s: 21:00 (on 25/4) US Pacific time; 23:00 (on 25/4) US Central time; 09:45 in Nepal; 12:00 in Perth, Singapore, Malaysia, Taiwan, China; 14:00 on the east coast of Australia and 16:00 in New Zealand.  Look forward to seeing you there.  It’s a half hour online event via Zoom, with registration through Eventbrite …https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/102970910766Figure 2: I launch my book, titledFood product development for the home entrepreneur, with Dr Yakindra Timilsena on Sunday 26 April.So here we go, this is section 3.3, Shelf-life and food spoilage…Food, by its very nature, is perishable.  It’s of biological origin and is produced in the agricultural environment. Therefore, the presence of microorganisms on and sometimes in the raw material, along with the finished food product, is unavoidable.  Of course there are many instances of product contamination that are avoidable.  Biofilms on processing equipment, non-aseptic filling and poor hygiene practices of food processing line workers are instances of avoidable contamination. When one considers potential for microbial contamination, there are vast differences between commodities, with each type of raw material and finished product having its own characteristic microflora and spoilage, as well as safety considerations. This reflects the natural flora of the primary production environment and of the prevailing conditions within the food, the conditions which can dictate growth and hence the type of microorganisms that grow there. Shelf-life, what limits it and how best to extend it, is a complex process in which many factors come into play. Each factor needs to be considered individually, then in concert with one another, and not just at a single point in time, but how these factors play out along the usually complex agrifood supply chain with the dynamic microbial communities present.It’s important to reach a stage of relative satisfaction with regard to a so-called ‘base’ formulation for your product. A formulation that one could make subtle changes to or tweak, in response to what shelf-life investigations might reveal. With the intended supply chain in mind, and the base formulation in place, shelf-life trials can commence. Of course, the best way to approach this is to simulate shelf-life, and indeed this is the most obvious, simplest and the one which would yield the most precise results. However, in the case of long shelf-life products, and we’re talking about products with a shelf-life as long as one or two years here, the conduct of a shelf-life trial for two years may be impractical. Under such circumstances, accelerated shelf-life trials or predictive modelling can be undertaken, and there are various research papers in the scientific literature describing mathematical modelling of the growth of various microorganisms from a spoilage or safety consideration.To know where to start extending shelf-life, it is important to know some basic facts – such as the current shelf-life, the preservation approaches currently employed, what limits shelf-life, length of the current and anticipated supply chain and the expected environmental conditions experienced, along with the microbiological quality of the raw materials and the processing environment. This information, coupled with an understanding of the typical spoilage or pathogenic microorganisms associated with that food, will give an excellent indication as to how shelf-life can be extended. There are many ways to extend shelf-life – chemical preservatives, traditional processes such as heat and a myriad of new and emerging non-thermal methods of food preservation, among others. Some are better suited to certain food types, certain microorganisms or may have other constraints related to the supply chain or economic considerations.","food microbiology, food product development, food science, food spoilage, product development"
Bacteria,"bacteria, viruses",COVID-19 or Wuhan pneumonia?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/covid-19-or-wuhan-pneumonia/,"March 29, 2020","This is a controversial topic, with potentially racial connotations, apparently, but are they justified?  Media and politicians have got into ‘hot water’ this year for their names/remarks/statements of association of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 with its country/city/culture/race of origin, an example of which is shown in Figure 1.  Are these comments appropriate/suitable or are they racially derogatory?  What I want to point out there are the origins of the names of some important viruses and the diseases they cause.  A bit of historical context which shows similarities and differences over the last 130 years or so.  This doesn’t necessarily make the current situation right or wrong, but I just wanted to put it into perspective with some historical context.  Yes, times change and what was acceptable in the past may not be acceptable today.  However, I did want to point out that the name “COVID-19” does seem inconsistent with historical naming of pandemic viruses and their diseases.  When we consider the names of foodborne bacterial pathogens, the current viral naming convention seems even more out of place.  However this is the 21st century and we are experiencing and unprecedented event, which may also apply to naming conventions.Figure 1: Donald Trump’s “famous” tweet on 17 March 2020.Let’s start with some biology – viruses, by their very nature, are different from everything else in the biological world.  They are considered in studies of biology, but it needs to be pointed out that viruses are not living organisms as they don’t satisfy the seven criteria of life (Figure 2).  Unless they infect a host cell, they are simply an inert package of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat.  As they are not living organisms, their nomenclature is also very different.  Taxonomists have attempted to place them in a hierarchal taxonomic scheme, but due to their fundamental differences with all living things, it isn’t the same.  Thus, their names tend to be rather informal, especially when compared to the strict naming conventions of living things; animals, plants, bacteria, fungi and others.Figure 2: Characteristics of living things.What prompted this blog post was a petition I signed late in January regarding what I (and tens of thousands of others) considered at the time to be a rather racist reference on the front page of theHerald Sun, a Melbourne newspaper (Figure 3).  However now, I wondering if it was really that bad.  Let’s explore.Figure 3: The front page of Melbourne’sHerald Sunnewspaper on 29 January 2020.The front page of theHerald Sunon that day referred to the nCoV-2019 (as it was still known at the time) as the “Chinese Virus”.  There was an uproar over this racially orientated headline and the newspaper forced to apologise.  However, when one looks back over the names of other viruses and the diseases they’ve caused, the name seemed quite fitting.  SARS-CoV-2 (as it is known now) originated in China and in Wuhan specifically.  Therefore, calling the virus the “Chinese Virus” and maybe calling the disease “Wuhan pneumonia” rather than COVID-19 is more meaningful.  This is especially when one considers other viral (influenza) pandemics last century and late in the 19th century.  The 1889-1890 influenza pandemic that originated in Bukhara, Uzbekistan (which then was a semi-independent state under Russian protection) is known as Russian flu; the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic is known as  Spanish flu (Figure 4) because the Spanish, not subject to wartime media censorship, reported more details of the sickness, death and suffering more than anywhere else in the world; the 1957-1958 influenza pandemic which originated in China’s Guizhou province is known as Asian flu (Figure 5); while the 1968 influenza pandemic which originated in Hong Kong is known as Hong Kong flu (Figure 6).  Furthermore, the H5N1 influenza outbreak of 2004 which originated in Thailand and Vietnam is commonly known as avian or bird flu, while the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 which originated in Mexico is known as swine flu… …and how about the last Coronavirus outbreak?  That started in 2012 and caused by MERS-CoV, with the disease called Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome.  This is the official name given to the disease by the WHO.  Why? …because the disease originated in the Middle East.  With all this in mind, we’re calling the disease of the current Coronavirus pandemic COVID-19?  That really seems out of place while Chinese or Wuhan pneumonia seems more appropriate.  Ok, so that’s some history of names of viral diseases and the viruses that cause them.  Let’s turn our attention to bacteria, especially foodborne disease pathogens.Figure 4: The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic was known as the Spanish flu.Figure 5: The 1957-1958 influenza pandemic was known as the Asian flu.Figure 6: The 1968 influenza pandemic was known as the Hong Kong flu.As a point of comparison, some of the biggest names in foodborne bacterial pathogens, some of which are zoonotic, areSalmonella, Escherichia(especiallyE. coli) andListeria, all of which are named after people, as wereShigellaandYersinia.  These bacteria were usually named after the scientists who discovered them.Escherichianamed after Theodor Escherich from Germany (Figure 7).Listerianamed after Joseph Lister from England.Salmonellanamed after Daniel Elmer Salmon from the United States (Figure 8).Shigellanamed after Kiyoshi Shiga from Japan.Yersinianamed after Alexandre Emile Jean Yersin from Switzerland.Figure 7: The name origin forEscherichiabacteria.Figure 8: The name origin forSalmonellabacteria.Especially with bacterial names, it is a great honour and privilege to have a bacterium named after you, yet China and Wuhan consider it a dishonour.  We call H1N1 swine flu and H5N1 bird flu – do we consider if this is a dishonour to pigs and birds?  So, from this we can see that microbial names and/or the diseases they cause have typically reflected some key and/or specific aspect of their origin, but COVID-19?  it really doesn’t seem to match, especially based on historical naming conventions, but is now considered racially derogatory (Figure 9) …unless the World Health Organization or others are breaking with tradition and starting a new nomenclature convention?Figure 9: Many viral pandemics have been named based on where they originated.This actually does seem to be the case, to some extent. The reader is referred to a comprehensive paper written by the Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on virus and specifically Coronavirus nomenclature and taxonomy (Gorbalenyaet al., 2020). It was published online inNature Microbiologyon 2 March 2020 The details presented highlight the highly scientific based approach to viral taxonomy, even though the names settled on for viruses may not always seem particularly scientific. In particular, I draw attention to this extract from their paper: “Apart from disease, geography and the organism from which a given virus was isolated also dominate the nomenclature, occasionally engraving connections that may be accidental (rather than typical) or even stigmatising, which should be avoided”.  There seems to be some errors in wording of this sentence, but you get the gist.  From this one can see that scientists are working hard to bring formal naming rules into practice (that fit into taxonomic hierarchy) which accurately reflect the disease and entity causing disease, while ensuring the names avoid stigmatising cultures, groups or countries.  So yes, times change, people change, everything changes.  These improved naming conventions have changed the way pandemics and their viruses are named.  Therefore, COVID-19 is an accurate way to scientifically represent this disease by name, rather than “Wuhan pneumonia”, which is not appropriate in many ways, not even in casual/informal conversation.ReferenceGorbalenya, A.E., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S.et al.The speciesSevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2.Nat Microbiol5,536–544 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z","bacteriology, clinical microbiology, food microbiology, medical microbiology, microbiology, nomenclature, taxonomy, virology"
Bacteria,bacteria,Isolation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/isolation-of-vibrio-parahaemolyticus/,"February 28, 2020","This is an update of an extract of a report I wrote in 1998 – this extract covers the fundamentals ofVibrio parahaemolyticusisolation.  Certainly, rapid and molecular methods have progressed in the past 22 years! …but the basic principles of isolation of this organism remain, such as saline conditions and TCBS Agar.Vibrios are ecologically important marine organisms (Figure 1), and since the natural habitat ofVibriospecies are marine environments, they do have a tolerance and sometimes preference for salty conditions, with regard to growth.  As a rule, NaCl stimulates growth of vibrios and many cannot grow in the absence of it.  For example, Baronet al.(1994) states thatV. parahaemolyticus,V. vulnificusandV. hollisaeare amongst thoseVibriospecies which will not grow when NaCl is absent from the culture medium.  Although NaCl is required for growth of these species, there are limits, like all growth conditions.V. parahaemolyticusis less concerned with salt concentration, being able to grow from 0.5% – 10.0%, although the optimum is 3% (ICMSF, 1995).  This tolerance to high salt concentrations is used in culture media for differentiation betweenVibriospecies, although most media used for routine isolation ofV. parahaemolyticus(such as TCBS) is made up to 3% NaCl, as this is the amount of salt which allows for best growth of this species.Figure 1: Importance of vibrios to the functioning of the marine ecosystem.Figure 2: Prepared plates of TCBS agarWhen vibrios are suspected in a sample, the best medium to isolate them on is Thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose (TCBS) agar (Figure 2).  This medium has been used worldwide for over 40 years, and is the medium of choice when attempting to growVibriospecies (AWWARF, 1997).  A distinct advantage of TCBS is that it does not require sterilisation (autoclaving) prior to use.  The medium is selective and differential for vibrios.  Its selective property is based on the concentration of salt and high pH which allowsVibriospecies to grow while being inhibitory to other genera likely to be present in foods or clinical samples where vibrios are present and clinically important.  Differentiation between species ofVibriois also simple when using TCBS.  Sucrose is the largest single component of TCBS (Atlas, 1993), and this is fermentation of this sugar which is the basis for differentiating important species ofVibrio.  Colonies of sucrose fermenters (V. cholerae) appear yellow while those of non-sucrose fermenters (V. parahaemolyticusandV. vulnificus) are green (Figure 3).  The basis for this variance in colony colour is the acid alkaline conditions which result from the fermentation or non-fermentation of sucrose.  The fermentation product must then be acidic, resulting in the yellow colour, while the colony colours are yellow and blue/green because the indicator incorporated into the medium is bromthymol blue.  This indicator turns yellow at the slight acidic pH of 6.0 and blue at the slightly alkaline pH of 7.6 (Brady and Holum, 1993).  Alternatives to TCBS include Bromthymol blue Teepol (BTBT) and Trypticase soy agar triphenyltetrazolium (TSAT) (Donovan & van Netten, 1995).Figure 3: Colonies ofVibrio parahemolyticuson TCBS.The TCBS plating method is the most traditional method for isolating vibrios, but like for all bacteria, a plethora of methods exist – cultural (such as chromogenic media), molecular, immunological and others.  The reader is referred to a particularly comprehensive insight into testing methodologies by the FAO for further information (FAO/WHO, 2016).  Despite their acceptance, stemming from reliability-based performance,  traditional cultural methods (for any bacterium) have a major disadvantage in processing, especially if enrichment and confirmatory tests are required.  In such cases, the entire process could take the best part of a week.  Thus, a variety of rapid methods have been researched and developed.   These include ELISA (Chenet al., 1992; Chen & Chang, 1995; Kumaret al., 2011), DNA hybridisation (Leeet al., 1992; McCarthyet al., 2000), PCR (Bejet al., 1999; Lee & Pan, 1993; Leeet al., 1995; Karunasagaret al., 1996; Wanget al., 1997; Ward & Bej, 2006) and fluorogenic assays (Miyamotoet al., 1990; Venkateswaranet al., 1996).  Although all these techniques are rapid, they are of varying usefulness.  PCR would probably be the best, with cost being the main drawback.  It is an extremely sensitive method, being able to detect as few as four cells per millilitre (Wanget al., 1997) or ten cells in a fish sample ofV. parahaemolyticus(Karunasagaret al., 1996) and offers tremendous time savings (Figure 4).  Due to the very nature of PCR, it has an extremely high specificity, provided primers to species-specific proteins are used.  Selection of such target proteins should not be a difficult task, with some options being the conserved ribosomal gene spacer sequence (RS), repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence (REP), and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus sequence (ERIC), investigated by Wong and Lin (2001).  Many other methods have low specificity, due to cross reaction with other closely related species (Chenet al., 1992; Chen & Chang, 1995; Venkateswaranet al., 1996) or are potentially unsafe due to radioactivity (Leeet al., 1992).  These techniques are generally not as sensitive as PCR, although Miyamotoet al.(1990) found their fluorogenic assay to be very sensitive, as it was able to detect ten cells per gram.  Although PCR is probably the best method for isolatingV. parahaemolyticus, its universal and routine usage (and incorporation into The Australian Standards) is unlikely in the very near future due to the expense involved in purchasing a thermocycler.Figure 4: Flowchart for culture-based confirmation ofVibrio parahaemolyticuscompared with PCR.The enrichment step is an important part of the isolation process, and aims to ensure all viable cells present, do in fact grow on the isolation medium.  Some may be injured or otherwise non-culturable but still potentially viable under ideal conditions.  It is these cells which the enrichment process attempts to recover, or revive.  The traditional and standard method of enrichment ofV. parahaemolyticusis with alkaline peptone water (APW).  This medium is listed in Donovanet al.(1995) alongside others considered suitable for use as enrichment, such as salt polymyxin broth (SPB) or glucose salt teepol broth (GSTB).  Researchers who have looked at the various enrichment broths have found APW to give the best results.  Eyleset al.(1985) found that APW was 111% more effective than GSTB while Hagenet al.(1994) investigated APW and SPB, and found APW to be the superior enrichment medium.  The benefits afforded by APW are reflected by its inclusion in The Australian Standard method.ReferencesAtlas, R.

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-safety, viruses",Putting COVID-19 and foodborne disease into perspective.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/putting-covid-19-and-foodborne-disease-into-perspective/,"February 21, 2020","There’s no doubt as to the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2 (the causal agent of COVID-19 disease), indeed this was highlighted by the World Health Organization giving this epidemic the status of aPublic Health Emergency of International Concern(PHEIC) on January 30 – you can read the minutes of the meeting where the declaration was made > (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov).  However, hysteria aside, we need to put it into perspective.  As of today, there are 76 819 reported cases and 2 250 deaths – certainly serious by any measure.  This of course may be under reported and needs to be taken as a guide only.  Interestingly, this current global figure is similar to what the actual number of cases in Wuhan alone was predicted to be as at January 25, from the work of Wuet al.(2020), researchers from the The University of Hong Kong.  Therefore, from the “official” figures,  the crude calculation of case fatality rate (CFR) of this disease, which is currently at 2.5% needs to be taken very much as a guide only and treated with a great deal of caution.  While the total number of reported cases is clearly substantially greater than SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012 (Figure 1), it offers some (and I stress,some) guidance.  Whatever the situation turns out to be, the CFR rate is on the low side when compared with SARS and MERS (Figure 2), with younger healthy people rarely succumbing to the disease, meaning those that are in their senior years or immunocomprised in some way represent those that typically die from the COVID-19 disease.Figure 1: Comparison of the number of reported cases and reported deaths of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS and MERS.Figure 2: Case Fatality Rates (CFRs) of SARS in 2002/2003, MERS in 2012 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019/2020.An important epidemiological concept to consider is theBasic Reproduction Number, known as “R0”.  This number describes how quickly an infectious agent spreads, and is basically related to how many people one infected individual can infect.  An excellent article about this concept can be found here > (https://www.vox.com/2020/2/18/21142009/coronavirus-covid19-china-wuhan-deaths-pandemic).  The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is on the low side of the scale (although two to three fold higher than seasonal Influenza) (Figure 3) and if you do acquire the virus, chances of a complete recovery are extremely high.  This is especially so if you are in the 10-39 age group, where the CFR is just 0.2% (Figure 4, which shows data from mainland China – data outside of mainland China show even lower CFRs).  In practical terms, this means that if you are aged between 10 and 39, and contract the virus, you have a 99.8% chance of making a full recovery.  Yet there is great fear amongst people, people taking all kinds of extreme measures to avoid being near people they consider represent ‘typical’ cases of the disease, even in countries like Australia and the US.  This irrational behaviour is certainly not justified, especially when one considers other diseases, with high CFRs.  Thus, social isolation of particular cultural groups and types of businesses operated by these people are of great concern and impact to (initially) the local economy, but later on, regional and maybe the global economy.Figure 3: Basic Reproduction Number (R0) of various key human infective viruses.Figure 4: Indicative CFR from COVID-19 reported cases in mainland China.Anyway, as I saying, there are other diseases with much higher CFRs -take listeriosis for example.  The CFR for listeriosis tends to hover around 20% overall (Figure 5), and is especially of concern for pregnant women who, if infected in the second or third trimester, are likely to survive, but their fetus will have a mortality rate of around 45%.  While this disease is relatively rare, with only 65 cases reported in Australia per year, its high mortality rate warrants extra care regarding exercising preventative measures.  Of even greater concern would be infection withVibrio vulnificus, the CFR of which is typically between 35 and 50% overall (Hlady & Klontz, 1996; Leeet al., 2013), usually due to consumption of raw oysters (Figure 6).  Despite this scary statistic, raw oyster consumption (which is the main vehicle of transmission of these bacteria from their natural marine habitat to humans) has remained popular over the years as evidenced by the reported outbreaks (CDC, 1993; CDC, 1996).  In fact, people seem to be so keen to consume raw oysters that they stick to belief in various myths they believe can protect them from infection, such as hot sauce and/or lemon juice having a killing effect on the bacteria – this is so not true!  In fact, it is laughable, a very humorous myth indeed.Figure 5: Comparison of the outcome of infection with key foodborne pathogens.Figure 6: Another death from eating raw oysters, due toVibrio vulnificusinfection.So, am I suggesting or advocating to take a casual stance with regard to SARS-CoV-2?  Far from it – what I’m actually saying is put everything into perspective.  There are times when one needs to exercise extreme caution, even when it may not seem warranted and times when one can be rather casual.  For example, we must think broadly and not only about ourselves.  Someone may be young and strong with a top performing immune system, but if their circumstances/actions might put others who are vulnerable, potentially in a bad position health-wise, then we must take more precautions than we consider necessary for ourselves.  Take for example, the recent spike of COVID-19 cases in South Korea.  Tens of cases are linked to one person, who refused to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, and has infected many people.  Even if she was in a low risk demographic (which she wasn’t be the way, being of age 61), she needs to consider that if she is infected, might it be of public health concern? might she infect other people?  This is what I mean by putting it all into perspective, considering it on a case-by-case basis and acting accordingly to prevent the spread of the infectious agent and thus doing a favour for your fellow human beings.  This is what needs to be paramount in one’s mind amidst a global pandemic, which according to epidemiological projections, won’t peak until April (Wuet al., 2020).The point to be made here is that there is almost hysteria surrounding infection with SARS-CoV-2, but many people are rather blaise about other infections that are actually severe, with a high death rate – such asListeria monocytogenesandVibrio vulnificusdiscussed above.  Please think logically and clearly when making choices and taking actions regarding infectious disease, disease prevention and public health implications –one poor choice can start a global pandemic,that’s all it takes.ReferencesCDC/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While the waterborneVibrio choleraehas been, is and almost certainly will continue to plauge human society, let’s turn our attention toVibrio parahaemolyticus(Figure 2).  UnlikeV. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticushas been known for a mere 70 years.  Although not to the grand scale ofV. cholerae, V. parahaemolyticushas firmly established itself as a key foodborne pathogen.  Let me explain, using text that I have mostly lifted from a report I wrote in 1998, but reviewed, revised and updated where appropriate.Figure 2: Real-life photo ofVibrio parahaemolyticuscells.V. parahaemolyticusis a common marine inhabitant (Figure 3) worldwide that has been recognised as an agent of gastroenteritis for the past 70 years.  The first documented case of foodborne disease byV. parahaemolyticusoccurred in Osaka, Japan – the year was 1950 (Josephet al., 1982).  Foodborne acquisition of this organism is most significant from marine environments and it is recognised as the most important seafood-borne pathogen, with the highest incidence of implication in foodborne disease cases involving seafood.  In fact, in some countries, such as China,V. parahaemolyticusis the leading cause of foodborne disease (Wuet al., 2018).  In addition to its prevalence in marine environments, it has been shown to be present in freshwater (Myatt and Davis, 1989) and in seafood caught from such areas (Sarkaret al., 1985), though this appears rare.  Although widespread, numbers vary seasonally (Figure 4), especially in temperate regions, where the bacteria are present in greater numbers during the summer months and this has been closely correlated with reported cases (Kelly and Stroh, 1988; Panet al., 1997).  However, shellfish, particularly oysters have been a common source of the infection (CDC, 1988; CDC, 1991; Klontzet al., 1993) and this is true not only forV. parahaemolyticus, but for many otherVibriosspecies (Hlady and Klontz, 1996).Figure 3: Presence ofVibrio parahaemolyticusin the marine environment.Figure 4: Seasonality ofVibrio parahaemlyticus(Cruzet al., 2015).Gastroenteritis is the condition most often experienced when people are infected withV. parahaemolyticus, with diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and nausea seen in at least 70% of cases (ICMSF, 1995).  Other disease syndromes have been reported, such as a cholera-like disease (Mhaluet al., 1982), septicaemia (Rabinowitchet al., 1993), wound infections (Plotkinet al., 1994) and dysentery (Gilmanet al., 1980).  It is often self-limiting and rarely fatal.  However, deaths have been reported (Thamlikitkul, 1990; Kraa, 1995).A key aspect of both isolation ofV. parahaemoyticusand relationship to human pathogenicity is the so-called “Kanagawa phenomenon”.  The Kanagawa phenomenon is a beta-haemolytic reaction (Figure 5) caused by the thermostable direct haemolysis (Okuda & Nishibuchi, 1998) that takes place on a specific medium, and is closely associated with pathogenicity.  Growth conditions for production of the heat-stable haemolytic are influenced by a range of growth parameters, including pH and type of carbohydrate in the medium (Chunet al. 1975).Figure 5: An early image of Kanagawa phenomenon beta-haemolysis on Wagatsuma blood agar (Chunet al., 1975).The testing of clinical samples forVibriospp. by laboratories in coastal areas, especially those in warmer regions, should be a routine procedures when a patient presents with symptoms which are typical ofVibrioinfection, such as gastroenteritis.  This is due to the abundance ofV. parahaemolyticusin the marine environment and the potential that all seafood could be contaminated.  Despite this abundance, 99.5% of environmental isolates ofV. parahaemolyticusare reported to be Kanagawa negative (Miyamotoet al.(1969), meaning the vast majority of environmental isolates are non-pathogenic too humans.  This is significant because 88% to 95% ofV. parahaemolyticusisolates from patients infected with this species are Kanagawa positive (Miyamotoet al., 1969; Wonget al., 2000), with reports on infection by Kanagawa negativeV. parahaemolyticusrare (Johnsonet al., 1984).  Despite this, Kanagawa positive isolates are considered virulent isolates (Okuda & Nishibuchi, 1998).In seven decades,Vibrio parahaemolyticushas established as a pathogen of global significance.  Its ubiquity in the marine environment ensures that it remains a leading cause of foodborne illness, in various parts of the world.ReferencesCenters for Disease Control (CDC. (1991).

Bacteria,"bacteria, food-safety, public-health, viruses",Zoonoses and foodborne disease,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/zoonoses-and-foodborne-disease/,"February 11, 2020","The current 2019-nCoV (example image in Figure 1) global pandemic has highlighted the importance of; animal reservoirs (and intermediate animal hosts) of disease, animal origins of human disease and zoonotic diseases and raises (again) the possibility of potential foodborne Coronavirus transmission.  This disease has been postulated to have crossed, probably in late November 2019, from animals to humans at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (Figure 2) in Wuhan, China.  I say postulated, because there are more links between this market and early reported cases of the disease, than not.  In fact, 55% of all cases reported in 2019 (n = 425) had contact with the market (Liet al., 2020).  However, interestingly, the first reported case had no contact with this market.  Thus, an element of doubt exists regarding the degree of involvement of this market.  Anyway, this  huge ‘wet’ market comprises over 1 000 stalls and is a substantial trading area for a multitude of different species of animals, both live and dead.  Most of the trade is for food purposes, i.e. human consumption, but some are for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), where certain body parts of sometimes rare species are used for therapeutic purposes.Figure 1: What Coronaviruses look like.Figure 2: Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China.While the presence of this, or indeed other, viruses in animals sold as food doesn’t constitute a foodborne disease as such, in theory they could very well be a foodborne disease, in addition to their recognition as a zoonoses.  However, the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (2015) has stated that no direct evidence exists for foodborne transmission of the SARS Coronavirus or the H5N1 Influenza virus and that direct contact with animals is the likely means of transfer of these viruses from animals to humans.  Presumably this could be the situation with 2019-nCoV too?  However, Rodriguez-Morales (2020) states “the possibility of foodborne transmission from animal derived matter which has recently been highlighted to influence the current epidemic”.  Certainly, the potential for foodborne transmission is there but they would probably get stopped in their tracks, so to speak, during cooking, since viruses tend to be rather heat sensitive.Figure 3: Some bacterial zoonotic diseases.All this got me thinking and investigating online about zoonoses in general, and I was reminded that many, many diseases are in fact zoonotic (Figure 3).  I forgot that HIV/AIDS was (is?) a zoonoses that originated in a non-human source.  Many other common diseases, including recognised foodborne disease are zoonotic as well.  In fact, typically the two most common foodborne diseases in many parts of the world, infection fromCampylobacterand fromSalmonella, are considered zoonotic infections.  These of course, primarily originate from poultry flocks, with occurrence so widespread that it is safer to regard or poultry and poultry products (for example eggs) as contaminated, than non-contaminated.  Fortunately from the perspective of public health, these bacteria have low heat resistance and are easily eliminated by standard cooking procedures.  By and large, the same could be said for viruses present in animals as food sources.  However, while the temperature for viral inactivation might be similar to bacteria, they rate of inactivation is seen to be slower.  Therefore, a pasteurisation process may not be effective in eliminating viruses like it is for elimination of bacteria.Figure 4: Scene at a wet market in Wuhan, China.  Credit to the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong for this image.Figure 5: Guangzhou, China in 2013. The original caption on flickr reads “To the left are the still alive rabbits, in the middle are the skins from the already sold ones-skin for sale as well at that stage, and to the right are two halves of fresh killed rabbit for sale. All for only 17 RMB per kilo. Source: https://www.flickr.com/photos/cookiesound/9637285106Another aspect to consider is the complexities of managing the microbial or disease-free status of animals that are sold as food.  In western countries, where the palate might be regarded as simpler, a rather limited number of animal species are reared for food purposes.  The vast majority of animal meat consumed probably comes from a limited number of species, most of which are farmed (rather than wild caught) under tightly controlled and regulated agriculture or aquaculture environments.  This enables the farmer and government regulators to closely monitor disease status and in turn, act swiftly if something is amiss with regard to the health status of the animals which might post a threat to human health.  With such controls, regulation and monitoring in place, foodborne disease outbreaks still occur that can be traced back to primary production.  Imagine then, in a market where a myriad of animal species are sold – some alive and some dead, some wild-caught and some from small-scale family farms (Figures 4 and 5).  With less knowledge and less understanding of the disease status of the animals, the presence of asymptomatic infections and how to manage any risks, one would think this situation poses an almost insurmountable task with regard to personal safety, food safety and indeed public health.  For example, we just really don’t know what is going on with wild animal reservoirs of human disease (Figure 6) and indeed, the animal origins of human disease.  As we are not (and from a practical perspective, cannot do so) monitoring wild animal populations for their disease status, or asymptomatic infection status, we just don’t know what viruses, bacteria or protozoan parasites they are harbouring and how they are mutating and if and when they might cross the species barrier to other animal species or humans.Figure 6: Some animal reservoirs of some human diseases.It seems there are many sources of the problem, with Liet al.(2020) raising another when they state that positive attitudes towards the consumption of wild-caught game meat is at the root of the problem.  Regardless, I feel that this 2019-nCoV situation reminds us to be vigilant – there is much we don’t know about virulence and pathogenesis of infectious diseases and even when we have controls, monitoring and regulations in place, anything can still go amiss, simply because we’re dealing with an unpredictable dynamic biological system.  Therefore, as a global community let’s work together, let’s contribute together, let’s share together!ReferencesAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food Adhoc Group on Foodborne Viral Infections.

Blog,blog,Understanding Maine’s Cottage Food Laws: Empowering home-based food entrepreneurs.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/understanding-maines-cottage-food-laws-empowering-home-based-food-entrepreneurs/,"July 13, 2023","The primary regulatory agency responsible for food safety in Maine is the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), specifically the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC). The Maine CDC’s Division of Environmental Health is tasked with enforcing and regulating food safety practices across the state.  In this article, we’re providing an overview of how home-based food entrepreneurs in the US state of Maine can manufacture food at home for commercial sale.Cottage food laws are regulations that allow individuals to produce and sell certain food products from their home kitchens without the need for a commercial facility. These laws enable home-based food entrepreneurs to start small businesses and generate income while ensuring consumer safety. This article provides a comprehensive summary of Maine’s cottage food laws, outlining the key provisions, requirements, and limitations.Overview of Maine’s Cottage Food Laws:Maine’s cottage food laws are designed to promote local entrepreneurship and support small-scale food producers. The laws, which fall under Title 22, Chapter 563 of the Maine Revised Statutes, define the parameters for individuals to prepare and sell non-potentially hazardous food items from their homes.Permissible food products:Maine’s cottage food laws allow the production and sale of specific food products that are considered non-potentially hazardous. These include baked goods (such as bread, cookies, and cakes), candy, confections, jams, jellies, fruit pies, and dry herbs and seasonings. However, perishable items, such as dairy products, meats, and canned goods, are excluded from the scope of cottage food production.Registration and licensing requirements:To sell cottage food products in Maine, individuals must register their business with the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The registration process involves providing basic information about the food products, ingredients used, labeling, and intended methods of sale. Registration is valid for two years and must be renewed thereafter.Labeling requirements:Proper labeling is a crucial aspect of cottage food production in Maine. All cottage food products must be labeled with the following information:The common or usual name of the product.The ingredients, listed in descending order by weight.The net weight or net volume of the product.The name and address of the cottage food operation.A statement that the product is homemade and not subject to state inspection.Selling and distribution:Maine’s cottage food laws allow home-based food entrepreneurs to sell their products directly to the end consumers. Cottage food operators can utilize various methods of sale, including selling at farmers markets, roadside stands, fairs, festivals, and through online platforms. However, wholesale distribution and selling to restaurants, grocery stores, or other retail establishments are not permitted under cottage food laws.Food safety and training:While cottage food operations in Maine are not subject to the same level of regulation as commercial food establishments, basic food safety practices must be followed. Cottage food operators are encouraged to complete a food safety training course to ensure proper handling, preparation, and storage of their products. By adhering to good hygiene practices and maintaining a clean working environment, operators can ensure the safety and quality of their cottage food products.Sales limitations and income thresholds:Maine’s cottage food laws place certain limitations on the sales volume and income thresholds for home-based food entrepreneurs. The sales limit for cottage food operators was $10 000 USD per calendar year. Once this threshold is reached, the producer must transition to a commercial kitchen and comply with the corresponding regulations.Conclusion:Maine’s cottage food laws provide an avenue for aspiring entrepreneurs to turn their culinary skills into a home-based business. By permitting the sale of non-potentially hazardous food items, the state enables individuals to generate income while ensuring consumer safety through basic registration, labeling, and food safety requirements. Although limitations exist, such as sales thresholds and restrictions on wholesale distribution, Maine’s cottage food laws offer a supportive framework for local food producers to flourish and contribute to their communities. As regulations may change over time, it is essential for cottage food operators to stay updated with the latest requirements and seek guidance from relevant authorities for a successful and compliant business venture.","food microbiology, food regulations, Food safety, food science, food standards, foodborne disease"

These regulatory bodies work together to maintain food safety and protect public health throughout Alabama.","cottage food, food entrepreneur, food law, food microbiology, Food safety, food standards"
Blog,blog,Food waste: Post-harvest losses and what you can do about it.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-waste-post-harvest-losses-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/,"April 3, 2022","What we eat today often has to travel thousands of miles to reach our plates, and much of that journey involves storing food in environments that are not ideal. This means that, unfortunately, some parts of your food will spoil before you have the chance to enjoy them. In this article, we’ll explain why food spoilage happens and the different stages of spoilage, along with simple tips you can use to prevent food from spoiling at home.An overview of waste, food spoilage and microbiologyWaste is any material that is discarded after primary use. There are two types of waste; biodegradable waste or non-biodegradable waste, also known as trash or garbage. Biodegradable materials are organic and carbon based, such as food waste, paper products and textiles. Non-biodegradable wastes are substances such as chemicals, metals, glass and plastic. Food spoilage refers to food that has either deteriorated from improper handling, packaging or storage after harvest or been contaminated by bacteria or moulds at some point during its life cycle . Microbiology is a field of science focused on microscopic organisms , which may be unicellular (one cell) organisms like bacteria or multicellular (many cells) eukaryotes including animals, plants etc.Relationship between food waste and food securityThere is a strong relationship between food waste and food security. One of every nine people around in world suffer from chronic hunger (UN, 2016). The Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations has estimated that there are around 1.3 billion tons of wasted food annually (FAO, 2014). It has been estimated that each year in US alone approximately 133 billion pounds of food ends up as waste at an economic loss of $162 billion.The problem of food wasteAlthough food is being lost in almost every step of its production, we tend to only think about how much food is wasted by consumers. Because we can see and measure how much food is thrown away, it seems logical that if we could just get consumers to stop wasting so much food, then there would be enough for everyone. However, when we take a closer look at each stage of production, along with transportation, we realize that 40% of all food globally goes to waste before reaching our plates. In fact, over 60% of fruits and vegetables are never harvested due to aesthetic standards or because they don’t meet other quality standards. The amount of energy required to produce food that ends up going to waste is astounding—we’re talking about 1/3 of all agricultural land on Earth. And if that isn’t bad enough, remember that food waste also has an impact on climate change; between 25-30% of total global greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture.The causes of food wasteFood is lost in its production, harvesting, processing, retailing, distribution and consumption phases. In fact, agriculture itself accounts for up to 30% of food wasted globally. With regards to supermarkets alone, each year billions of dollars worth of nutritious food is left on fields or discarded because produce does not meet aesthetic standards set by consumers. When goods leave supermarkets, a lot more food still ends up in landfills than is eaten (about 40% overall), thus contributing to greenhouse gas emissions as well as environmental degradation – particularly because most landfills are poorly designed. Some studies have found that methane emission from decomposing organic materials like food are 21 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping heat in our atmosphere over 100 years after they’re emitted.Tricks to make your produce last longerPreventing food from spoiling starts before you even get home. When shopping, plan your meals for that week to make sure you’re not buying more than you need—or paying for more food than will be eaten. Store your produce properly at home, too. Certain fruits and vegetables go bad quicker than others, but even so, there are a few quick tips to help them last longer in your fridge or pantry. Learn how to store various produce types below! You might be surprised by just how long they’ll keep fresh with these simple tricks. You could also save money on groceries by growing some of your own food in an urban garden. Find out which plants grow best in small spaces with our handy guide. Don’t have any space? Even if you live in an apartment, there’s still plenty of room to grow herbs on windowsills or tiny succulents indoors. Gardening is fun and rewarding, plus when it comes time to eat your homegrown goodies, they’ll taste that much better knowing you took such good care of them from seed all the way through harvest!","food microbiology, food preservation, food science, food security, food spoilage"

In this first video, I introduce HACCP – what it is, its origins, its scope and then cover hazard analysis as the first step in the HACCP process.  This is the step to identify anything that presents a potential hazard and if identified as such, must be controlled or eliminated, as that means it would be a health (illness or injury) risk to consumers. Some important points to note are; I) That HACCP is a preventive system, rather than a reactive system, which is what (finished) product quality control is and II) Like everything, HACCP is not a zero-risk system and will (dramatically) reduce hazards and incidents, but cannot guarantee elimination of those hazards.","food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, microbiology, quality management"
Blog,blog,Support registered food businesses,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/support-registered-food-businesses/,"August 7, 2021","Australia, through Food Standards Australia New Zealand, and the various state/territory and local governments, maintains high standards in all aspects of our food system.  This is particularly evident with regard to food safety and quality.  I want to point out these high standards that we enjoy with a specific example, the tight regulations that surround people selling home-cooked food.  Food is a hazardous commodity – many people get sick every year and people die every, by and large because people don’t follow precautions and steps that food safety experts, food microbiologists, state need to be followed.  While responsibility for food safety lies right across the entire agrifood supply chain from primary production, the agricultural environment, through food manufacturing and its associated storage and distribution, to retailing and the domestic environment.  Everywhere but the domestic environment is under strict control and very tight regulation by government authorities, to absolutely minimise the amount of food safety incidents that originate outside of the home.  This works, as comparatively few food safety incidents can be linked to the agricultural environment, manufacturing or retailing.  On the other hand, the domestic environment is only under control by consumers rather than government authorities.  Therefore as a result, we many more food safety incidence taking place in the domestic environment.Consumers, the general public, are generally not food safety trained.  Many have been following the same food preparation regime for years, or decades, and many have learnt their food safety practices from family and/or friends perhaps, or perhaps the mass media.  Really, there’s not many other outlets for food safety information, apart from government websites or government social media pages, and really, how many people go looking for food safety information on Instagram or follow the CDC or EFSA on Instagram?  Not too many general consumers I’m sure.  With a lack of real understanding about food safety, repeating questionable food safety practices being dnetaken and few channels that the general public would engage with that actually promote such information, it is not surprising that the incidence of food safety cases is highest in the domestic enrivonment.  Furthermore, it is likely to be even higher than what we know for sure because many self-limiting cases or even outbreaks perhaps, go undetected in the community.As examples, how many people actually test their meat temperature, thaw their meat correctly, avoid cross contamination by eliminating aerosol generation and surface recontamination and adhere to the strict timing that is necessary for foods to be out of the temperature danger zone?  Not too many, or at least not enough, that’s for sure.  For example, how many people have you seen doing the following unsafe and downright dangerous practices, without giving them a second thought, almost doing them routinely?Consuming their eggs runny.Not measuring the internal temperature of meat.Bringing rice to work and leaving it at room temperature for several hoursThawing meat on the kitchen bench.Allowing pets in the kitchen.All of these are pretty common occurrences in the domestic kitchen, yet are very unsafe indeed.  In fact, looking at the last one, I’ve stayed in homes as a visitor where not only is the dog of the house permitted to freely enter and wander through the kitchen, but at mealtimes, the dog even attempts to reach the plates of food on the dinner table.  With all these happening, who can trust unregulated and unregistered domestic kitchens to do that right with regard to food safety?  It’s bad enough when you are a visitor in a home, and being unable to control the food safety and hygiene practices, and so then, why would you buy food from an unregistered food business?  These days, there seems to be a proliferation of online food businesses, those that take orders online with payment made in cash only, and pick-up directly from their car in suburban carparks.  Of course, some of these could very well be registered with their local council as a food business, but the measures they take to be untraceable, it just makes you wonder if they are registered of not.  Is it worth the risk? based on the above unsafe food practices that are unfortunately all too common in the domestic environment.  If you are unsure, and to be safe, simply ask for proof of their council registration as a food business.  Such business can, and should be allowed to, fulfil an important part of the food culture.  The food available from such places is typically really authentic and helps building a culture-based community  through authentic food from faraway lands.  It also enables another source of income for the people preparing these meals.  However, it all must be done legally to ensure the high food safety standards in Australia are maintained and those vendors that do go through the lengthly and complex process of food business registration with their local government authorities are not disadvantaged for doing the right thing.  Ask for proof of registration and support our registered food businesses!For more information if you are thinking of starting a home-based food business, take a look at the link below:https://www2.health.vic.gov.au/public-health/food-safety/food-businesses/starting-a-food-businesshttps://www.foodstandards.gov.au/foodsafety/standards/Pages/Home-based-food-businesses.aspx","food entrepreneur, food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease"
Blog,blog,Safe food preparation,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/safe-food-preparation/,"May 2, 2021","The preparation of food provides many opportunities for breaches of food safety.  In the more relaxed domestic environment, ‘things’ take place that would be not be tolerated or illegal in a food service or food manufacturing environment.  This is certainly a significant contributing factor to the fact that more food borne disease originates in the home compared with anyone else.  Therefore, it can certainly be worthwhile to take a look at what takes place during professional food preparation or manufacture, and adapting those precautions for use in the domestic environment.  Some big ones that frequently face neglect in the home would include temperature control, personal hygiene and animals (pets) in the food preparation (Figure 1) and/or eating areas.  The precautions are simple and straight-forward to apply, but may not be what people are used to.  Therefore, it may take some practice for them to become second nature.  However, in addition, what is potentially more important is the people’s recognition of these as contributing factors and hence their desire to change their habits.  Such a shift in thinking doesn’t come easy after decades of repeated action.  Consequently, possibly a better approach is to work with children.  Children who are young and haven’t yet started to routinely cook and shop for ingredients.  We can introduce them to safe food practices and why, before they adopt actions from adults they live and associate with.  This could certainly be a way to ‘break the chain’ of generational food safety practices – poor food safety practices being passed from one generation to the next.Figure 1Safe food handlingWhile microbial contamination of food can originate from the natural or primary production (agricultural) environment, a significant cause of such food safety breaches can occur during food handling.  This could be during manufacture, commercial preparation in a food-service environment or in the home.  While strict food safety regulations are in place to ensure safe food handling during manufacture and in restaurants, cafes and other food service establishments, breaches may occur due to equipment or procedural failures, such as human error resulting from carelessness.  Human error resulting from ignorance may also occur, but it is typically the responsibility of a registered food premises’ food safety supervisor to ensure food safety breaches do not occur.There are multiple factors recognised in being significant as unsafe food handling practices.  These factors, and the actions taken to mitigate the associated risks, are consistent across any food handling area and does involve everyone involved in the handling of food to be consumed, not just the last person handling it for example.  Let’s take a look the specific factors.Temperature controlControl of temperature for prepared food or it’s ingredients is absolutely critical and easy to  achieve.  Temperature is one of the most fundamental parameters controlling the growth of microorganisms, and in countries like Australia, appropriate temperature control is readily available to ensure temperature abuse of food or food ingredients does not occur.  An important concept in food safety is the ‘hurdle’ concept to ensuring safe food (Figure 2).  This basically refers to multiple hurdles put in place, each of which will contribute to a reduction in the food safety risk.  For example, consider raw meat, as one of the risker food types  when it comes to foodborne disease risk.  To absolutely minimise food safety risk, it needs to be out of the temperature danger zone, which means chilled or frozen during transport and storage and held above 60 °C if not consumed immediately.  In addition, cooking to a specified internal temperature is required.  This means, for example, maintaining the cold chain from when it leaves the processing facility until it is to be cooked.  If there is poor temperature control in a refrigerated delivery vehicle or a delivery person leaves the delivery of meat non-refrigerated at the door of the restaurant, then these could contribute to an increase in any foodborne pathogenic bacteria present.  Then, if the chef doesn’t cook the food to the appropriate internal temperature or if an undercooked meat dish is requested, the consumer is leaving themselves vulnerable to foodborne disease.Figure 2Prevention of cross-contaminationThe prevention of cross-contamination is an important concept in food safety, because different food types pose different types of food safety risks.  While there have been various high-profile foodborne disease outbreaks over the years from fresh produce,  meats generally pose a greater risk compared with other types of foods.  Even within the meat category, chicken is generally considered higher risk than other meats due to the likelihood of contamination with one or both ofCampylobacter jejuniandSalmonellabacteria.  Therefore, it is imperative that food types that post different levels of food safety risk are handled separately.  This means, for example, different chopping boards, different utensils, washing hands between handling raw meats and vegetables, especially salad vegetables that are consumed raw (Figure 3).Figure 3Personal hygieneThe aim of personal hygiene in the food safety context is the elimination of transferring pathogenic bacteria from ourselves, as a food handler, to food.  This means, for example,  wearing appropriate protection to prevent product contamination, such as gloves and a face mask and changing gloves wear appropriate.  In particular though, elimination of the faecal-oral route as a means of foodborne disease transmission, is an important element in personal hygiene considerations for food handlers.  This typically means diligently washing hands after using the toilet and blowing your nose, which are parts of the body known to harbour higher amount of bacteria that could make people sick – this is even if they are not making you sick.  The story of Typhoid Mary in the United States (Figure 4) is an excellent example of how asymptomatic carriers are at great risk of spreading infectious disease.Figure 4Clean work environmentBy ensuring a clean work environment, we eliminate any areas where pests harbouring pathogenic microorganisms can remain and we also eliminate places where the pathogenic microorganisms themselves can accumulate.  Biofilms are an important, and troubling, concept for food manufacturers (Figure 5).  They are communities of microbial cells which can develop in food processing lines and resist efforts to remove them by typical cleaning procedures.  They can form in any areas of pipes for example, that are not smooth, and at times some of the cells can dislodge and contaminate the food or beverage product.Figure 5","food

Blog,blog,Commercial kitchen food safety,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/commercial-kitchen-food-safety/,"April 11, 2021","People consume food that has been manufactured in a food processing plant or prepared for immediate consumption in a domestic kitchen or a commercial kitchen.  Similar to food manufacturing facilities, commercial kitchens are tightly regulated environments, where organisation, plans, workflow and more, are paramount to the food safety success of that food service establishment.  Here are some of the ways that commercial kitchens maintain the high level of food safety required to ensure adherence to local food safety regulations.Commercial food preparationIn the fast-paced environment of a commercial kitchen, excellent planning and organisation is essential in order to maintain hygienic conditions and hence maintain appropriate food safety standards.  Every detail must be considered because even small oversights can, over time, slowly develop into major problems that can be difficult to reverse or rectify.  The principles used in ensuing high food safety standards, and indeed quality, are similar to a manufacturing environment, where dedicated areas for specific activities are required along with detailed standard procedures for routine tasks.Food storage roomsFood can spend some time in storage areas and it is therefore an absolutely vital requirement for their hygienic status to be maintained.  Clearly, temperature control and checking the temperature (Figure 1), along with humidity in some instances, is paramount for ingredients to be stored safely and to maintain it’s quality until use.  Although of extreme importance, consistent temperature control can be difficult without properly designed storage areas to eliminate warmer air repeatedly entering cold rooms.  Furthermore, a good system of storage will also assist in safe and quality ingredients as will a well-lit storage area.  This is because it will be easier to spot any food ingredients that have prematurely spoiled, with good lightning.Figure 1: Checking the temperature of a commercial kitchen refrigerated storage area.Work flow in the kitchenThe flow of work in a commercial kitchen is akin to a mini, non-automated, production line (Figure 2), or at least in principle it is.  This is so that there are dedicated areas for certain activities and food safety is not compromised through, for example, cross-contamination from raw to cooked foods.  The importance of a well-designed and well-planned kitchen cannot be underestimated, because ensuring everything has a place and everything is in it’s place, will go a long way to creating safe and high quality dishes.Standard operating proceduresFigure 2: Processes for flow of ingredients and dishes in a foodservice environmentHigh food safety standards occur not only from well designed work areas, but implementation of standard operating procedures that ensure routine procedures are carried out consistently in accordance with expectations for a given task outlined in written documentation.  One of the most widespread approaches in ensuring compliance with food safety regulations is the system known as HACCP – Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points.  This was developed in the 1960s for the United States’ space program to ensure safe food for astronauts on space missions.  It is a preventive system, and while a HACCP, when done properly, can reduce food safety risks to a negligible level, it will not guarantee food safety, but does absolutely minimise the risks.  Before actually establishing a HACCP plan, there are various preliminary steps that should be undertaken, as outlined in Figure 3.Figure 3: How to go about establishing a HACCP program.In brief, the HACCP system works through carefully identifying hazards that may pose a threat and putting checks in place to monitor those points in the workflow where such hazards cause unacceptable risks.  If such hazards are identified, a standard response to eliminate is documented along with checks to verify that all is on order.Why go to so much trouble you may ask … in both the food manufacturing and the food service sectors, releasing food that has chemical, physical or microbial hazards could have dire consequences for customers/diners or illness, injury or even death.  In the case of a food manufacturer, the financial consequences of a product recall associated with a  suspected food safety risk can be enough to close down a business.  Similarly, a foodborne disease episode or a foreign object found in a meal at a restaurant could damage a restaurant’s reputation to the point of no return.  Therefore, the time and money invested by a food business to reduce food safety risks to a negligible level through the development and implementation of a HACCP program is certainly going to be worthwhile to largely prevent food safety problems.  Of course, there’s no iron-clad guarantee that issues won’t surface, but a good HACCP program in place will provide peace of mind that almost nothing can go wrong, from the food safety perspective.Food safety programsThe importance of food safety programs, such as HACCP, are illustrated by them being mandated in many jurisdictions around the world, to prevent food safety issues.  When issues do occur, such an outbreak of foodborne disease traced to a particular food item, one could consider that one of two scenarios is likely.  Either, I) there has been a breakdown, a lapse in an aspect of any one (or more) of the seven steps of the HACCP system, or II) a change in manufacturing process or kitchen workflow has occurred, for example, or different ingredients are used or even the same ingredient but from a different supplier.  Even such small changes could have substantial impacts and a new HACCP plan needs to be draw up to accommodate that change.  The different supplier may source their product from a country where the food safety standards are lower or more contamination is likely.  In such a case, an extra control would need to be inserted in the HACCP plan to ensure this is accounted for.","commercial kitchen, food microbiology, Food safety, foodborne disease"
Blog,blog,Domestic food safety,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/domestic-food-safety/,"March 29, 2021","When dining out, we would expect the restaurant or cafe to strictly follow food safety protocols in their kitchen, as we don’t want to risk contracting a foodborne disease.  Therefore, why wouldn’t we do the same in our own home?  People feel most relaxed in  their own home, and it’s not uncommon for food safety standards to slip – it’s easy to fall into a false sense of security at home, with regard to food safety.  It is acknowledged in the scientific literature that incidents of foodborne disease are more likely to originate in the home, than anywhere else.  Therefore, it is vital to keep in mind that the same general ‘rules’ still apply, whether in the food manufacturing factory, in a restaurant or at home – everyone has a responsibility food safety, and it is important to remain ever vigilant to safeguard our health, and the health of our loved ones.  This is especially so because unlike a food manufacturing facility or a commercial kitchen, Azevedo (2014) notes that the home is a space serving many purposes.  Therefore, food preparation, consumption and indeed storage may take place in various parts of the domestic environment.   Let’s take a look at what we can do and how we can play our part to reducing the incidence of foodborne disease.Control of the temperature of food is easy to do at home due to the presence of domestic refrigerators.  However, it is one of the aspects that is easy to overlook too, or be careless about.  There are some general requirements that needs to be remembered, and the more you do them, the easier they become to remember.The temperature danger zone (Figure 1) is an absolutely essential aspect in food safety, especially so when precise temperature control in the home is generally not attempted.  Cold foods must be kept cold, below 5 °C, which is why we place them under refrigeration while hot foods must be  kept hot, above 60 °C.  At these temperatures, you are essentially ‘buying time’, which means an extension of the time you can hold or keep your your food.  Therefore essentially, you’re putting a pause on the ‘food safety clock’.  However, between 5 °C and 60 °C is the temperature danger zone for the growth of foodborne pathogenic bacteria, and is essentially when the clock starts ticking.  While the temperature danger zone covers a wide spectrum of temperatures, there are temperatures where it is most critical.  Between about 25 °C and 40 °C would be the most critical period of the temperature danger zone.  It is in this  temperature period where the bacteria we are most familiar with at causing foodborne disease, will grow and proliferate the fastest.  Here we’re talking about bacteria likeSalmonellaandE. colifor example, and between these temperatures, bacteria can double in number in as little as 20 minutes.  Another important point to remember is that few aspects are absolute.Listeria monocytogenes, for example, is called psychrotrophic, which means it is capable of growing at refrigeration temperatures, even though it prefers to grow at temperatures that are much higher.  This means that even refrigeration will not stop the growth of the important foodborne pathogenic bacterium.Figure 1: Temperature danger zone for food safetyFigure 2: The food safety 2 hour 4 hour rule.The ‘2 hour 4 hour’ rule ( is a critical element in food safety temperature control.  It provides option for what we can actually do to food held within the temperature danger zone for those periods of time.  In brief, the longer the food is held within the temperature danger zone, the fewer options you have.  Within the first two hours after food has been cooked, you can either I) serve for immediate consumption or II) chill to refrigeration temperature, meaning a temperature out of the temperature danger  zone.  After food has been held in the temperature danger zone for anywhere between two and four, it must be served, and consumed, immediately.  However, once the food reaches the point at which it has been held within the temperature danger zone for a period of four hours, it must be discarded – no further consumption can be safely allowed.  This rule is based on how fast foodborne pathogenic bacteria may grow at these temperatures and therefore when the food would become a health hazard.Figure 3: Thawing food under refrigeration is best.Thawing of food needs to follow both the above with regard to temperature danger zone and the 2 hour 4 hour rule.  When handling food, you need to minimise, or preferably eliminate, the amount of time it spends in the temperature danger zone.  When thawing food, it is possible to keep food out of the temperature danger zone completely (Figure 3) – it just takes time, and some planning.  Therefore, the ideal way to thaw frozen food for cooking is  under refrigeration.  At this temperature, it will thaw effectively (but will take very long, possibly up to 24 hours) with the temperature of the food product not entering the temperature danger zone.  This will give you peace of mind.  Other options for thawing food, which can be followed with care, are using the microwave or placing the food in a sealed bag, which is placed in cold water.  Both these bring the food into the temperature danger zone prior to cooking, meaning care must be taken to minimise the time the food spends at this temperature, by, for example, cooking it immediately.  Under no circumstances is frozen food to be thawed on the kitchen bench, at room temperature, unattended.ReferenceAzevedo, I., Albano, H., Silva, J., & Teixeira, P.

Blog,blog,A school student with a clear vision … to be a food microbiologist.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/a-school-student-with-a-clear-vision-to-be-a-food-microbiologist/,"March 13, 2021","Many young people have little idea for a career choice in the last year or two of secondary school.  They then take a generic undergraduate degree, like arts or science, as they still have a limited idea of their intended career when they get to university.  Some of them then plan a career, but it is not uncommon for others to almost fall into opportunities that come along.  That’s why we were so very impressed with Rukmini, a secondary school student in Mumbai.  When we came to know her, she was in Year 11, and already had an excellent idea of her career choice – working in the food safety area with WHO.  She sought mentoring to clarify a few aspects, and now she is in Year 12, and has a clear vision of how she wants her career as a food microbiologist to develop.  We wanted to discover just how such a bright mind thinks, why she likes this as a career and what inspired her and more.  The transcript below, of our interview with Rukmini provides some insights into her career plans.* Its not that common for someone of your age, at least not in Australia where I come from, to have a firm idea of what career you wish to follow – when did you feel that a career as a food microbiologist is what you want?From my childhood only I wanted to be a Research Institute. And as a subject I love biology. So one day I was watching a food series and Discovery Channel after watching it, and I had the curiosity that what jobs can I get which is related to both biology and food. So I browse to Google that what types of career paths are related with. So after searching for these, I got through a name of a career path which studied interaction between food microorganisms, and the environment to ensure food safety, quality and value. Food microbiologist also develop new and rapid methods to detect pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms and food. So by seeing all these things, my interest went towards it, and I thought it will be idle for me*I understand you ultimately want to work for the WHO – what contribution would you like to make to the great work they do?World Health Organization supports countries to improve their health outcomes. World Health Organization works worldwide to promote health and keep people safe. So my becoming a food microbiologist and working in food safety department, I would like to make contribution to the great work they do. I would study foodborne pathogens and work on disease prevention and NGO food production abide by government regulation regarding food, health, and safety.* Are there people that have inspired and encouraged you, thus making your career choice clearer?As I said, I always had an interest towards food and biology, specifically the part which is related to microorganisms. As my family business is in food industry, my father has inspired me to get into the career path which is related to it. And also Louis Pasteur inspired me a lot. Also, one day when I saw a YouTube video of Dr. Philip Button in this channel Food Microbiology Academy I had a lot more interest, and how can I forget, my mom always encouraged me making my career choice clearer and clearer.*What do you plan to do immediately after finishing school and why?Immediately after finishing my school, I would do bachelor’s degree in food science, as it will open my first scope to become a food microbiologist.*What satisfies you about a career in food safety?Foodborne illness is a serious threat towards health, food poisoning is a common public health problem nowadays. So I want to improve the foodborne diseases, which are caused by contamination of food. Foodborne disease is linked with the food safety department, just all about people getting sick and related to public health and personal health. So I think this is the area which perfectly satisfy me.*Ultimately, what would be your dream job?My dream job is to make a positive impact on people every day. So I would love to work in World Health Organization in food microbiologist department.*What does food safety mean to you and why is it important in the world?I think food safety is a practice that preserve the quality of food to prevent contamination and foodborne illness. Food safety is very much important to world because foodborne illness are preventable and underreported public health problem, these illnesses are a burden on public health and contributes significantly to the cost of healthcare. So food safety is a key to achieve several development goal and world food safety day brings it into spotlight to prevent and detect foodborne risks.","career choice, food microbiologist, food microbiology, Food safety, school student"
Blog,blog,Save your immune system for SARS-CoV-2!,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/save-your-immune-system-for-sars-cov-2/,"March 9, 2020","With person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 now occurring in Australia, its time to think about how best to protect the health of all in Australia.  This is not just a matter of personal health, this is a public health issue, one that may impact each and every one of us.  We don’t know who will be impacted and we don’t know to what extent, so we must take care to protect all.  Keeping ourselves well and being hygienic are key elements of what we can do.  Keeping ourselves well means we are fighting fit and strong, which implies a strong, robust and effective immune system through better lifestyle choices (Figure 1), and better food safety choices.  This way, our immune system has all its resources and strength to respond to SARS-CoV-2, should it invade our body.  Considering the frequency at which foodborne disease occurs in the community, now is really the time to be extra vigilant and extra hygienic – nothing should be considered too extreme when public health is at stake.  Therefore, what can we do to maximise the chances of a fully functioning immune system?Figure 1: Build you immunity with these lifestyle improvements.The United States Department of Agriculture have a catchy and effective food safety campaign for domestic food handling –clean,separate,cook,chill(Figure 2).  This is just as good as any reminder about how best to be safe with food in the home.  Not only to ensure we don’t get ill with foodborne disease, and therefore waste our immune system fighting off a foodborne pathogen rather than SARS-CoV-2, but also because we just don’t know the full story regarding transmission of SARS-CoV-2 … foodborne transmission might just be possible, in the home or indeed in a food service setting.  Think about it – an asymptomatic, careless or thoughtless food handler infected with SARS-CoV-2 might just breathe on your meal.  Might the virus survive long enough for you to ingest it?  It’s certainly possible.  Anyway, back to clean, separate, cook, chill, and therefore what you can do in the home to protect yourself from ‘market to mouth’, the part of the agrifood supply chain that consumers have control over.Figure 2: Clean, Separate, Cook, ChillCLEAN – Ensure everything in your kitchen is clean (Figure 3).  Your hands, food contact surfaces and food itself.  It isn’t unusual for the normal flora of our hands to includeStaphylococcus aureus, a bacterium that typically causes an intoxication style of foodborne disease.  However, just by being out of the home we touch countless surfaces, any of which could harbour an infectious microorganism.  Thus, wash your hands and wash them properly, paying attention to the areas in between the fingers, folds of the skin and under fingernails.  Food contact surfaces need to be disinfected – bench tops, sinks, chopping boards, plates.  Then, there is the food itself.  Meat, especially poultry and fish is almost always contaminated with foodborne pathogenic bacteria –CamplyobacterandSalmonellaon poultry andVibrioon fish.  Therefore, rinsing these meats will eliminate some of the infectious bacteria.  Fresh produce can also harbour pathogenic microorganisms, especially those that are grown and harvested directly from the soil.  Clean these particularly well –Listeria monocytogenescontamination of such vegetables has been known to occur.  A very important point to note, when cleaning food during the preparation stage, do so in a way that water and water droplets potentially containing the infectious microorganisms are not splashed and sprayed around the food preparation area.  I can’t stress this enough.  Do your cleaning with a gentle stream of water and slow, gentle handling procedures.Figure 3: CleanSEPARATE – Meat and vegetables (Figure 4), raw and cooked, separation is vital.  Meat is more likely to be contaminated with infectious pathogenic microorganisms compared to vegetables, and one of the main advantages of cooking is to eliminate infectious pathogenic microorganisms from food.  Therefore, if meat and vegetables or raw and cooked food touch each other or cross contamination occurs on a food contact surface, then that is bad news.  From a practical perspective, this could mean having separate chopping boards for different food types or different plates and cooking utensils for the same food, one for the raw food and one for the cooked food.Figure 4: SeparateCOOK – Heat is probably the best way to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms from food.  It is certainly the easiest, because all one has to do is cook food to the required temperature, and you’re done.  However, how do you know if you’ve got to that temperature?  this is particularly critical for meat, where the outside may look or actually be cooked, by the inside, deep inside can still be raw (Figure 5).  Therefore, thermometers are essential in this regard, to measure the internal temperature of roast meats for example, where the centre of the food is many centimetres from the surface.  Undercooked food That is meant to be eaten cooked) is a health hazard, as is raw food.  Put simply, don’t do it.Figure 5: CookDo not eat/drink;i) Raw or undercooked eggs,ii) Raw or undercooked meat, which means only ordering your steak ‘well done’.iii) Raw milk!  (Figure 6)Figure 6: Risks of raw milk consumption.Don’t be fooled into thinking that lemon juice or some other acidic treatment can “cook” your raw fish or other raw meat – it doesn’t, you’re still eating it raw (Figure 7).Figure 7: A popular raw seafood dish.CHILL – In food safety, the temperature danger zone is between 5°C and 60°C.  This means keep hot foods hot (i.e. above 60°C) and keep cold foods cold (i.e. below 5°C).  In the temperature danger zone, perishable or high-risk food can only be in the temperature danger zone for a total of four hours.  At the four hour mark, throw it out.  If you’re going to store food under refrigeration, then cool it promptly, which means getting it into the fridge promptly (Figure 8) and if you have a large amount of food to chill, then divide it up into smaller containers so that it cools faster.  Some examples of what not to do;Figure 8: Chilli) Do not bring meat or rice (Figure 9) for lunch and keep it at room temperature from morning to lunch time, this exceeds the four hours the food is in the temperature danger zone.ii) Do not thaw meat at room temperature or in water during the day from morning to dinner time, this exceeds the four hours the food is in the temperature danger zone.iii) Do not forget to promptly refrigerate leftovers and leave them at room temperature overnight, this exceeds the four hours the food is in the temperature danger zone.Figure 9: The food safety danger of cooked rice.Observe these straight-forward food safety guidelines to keep you and your loved ones safe.  It’s easy to do and means that you are more likely to save your immune system to fight off SARS-Cov-2!","cook clean chill separate, coronavirus, covid-19, food microbiology, Food safety, foodborne disease, sars-cov-2"

These areV. cholera,V. parahaemolyticusandV. vulnificus.Vibrioorganisms are Gram negative curved rods (Figure 1) which are facultatively anaerobic and most often motile by a polar flagellum.  They are common environmental organisms, although this varies between species.V. parahaemolyticushas the widest growth limits for all the major growth parameters of salt, temperature, water activity and pH.  All species prefer slightly alkaline conditions and sodium chloride stimulates growth.Figure 1: Cellular morphology ofVibriospp.Vibrios are widespread in the aquatic environment worldwide, although they predominate in marine waters, especially in estuarine habitats.  From Figure 2, one can see that vibrios are an integral part of the aquatic ecosystem in which they inhabit, with interactions between organisms in different kingdoms and at different trophic levels.  Their numbers fluctuate seasonally, with increases seen during water months.  However, their numbers are regarded as constantly being high.  From this, it has been suggested that all seafood should be regarded as being potentially contaminated withVibriospp.Figure 2: “It is now well accepted that Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the water-borne disease cholera, is acquired from environmental sources where it persists between outbreaks of the disease.”V. cholerais endemic in many tropical countries where high numbers of cases are continually recorded.  Most cases are reported on the African continent, with spikes in reported cases on a global basis typically due to extreme numbers of cases reported in the Americas in those years, such between 1991 and 1993 and in 2010 and 2011 (Figure 3).  Cholera is rarely reported in advanced economy countries, with Australia for example, reporting an average of three cases annually between 1991 and 2019.  In so-called “developed countries”,V. parahaemolyticusis more common.  This species is especially widespread in Japan where it causes the most cases of foodborne disease – a reflection of the dietary habits of the Japanese which includes raw seafood consumption.Figure 3: Global reported cases of cholera.By far the most common food implicated in transmission of Vibrios is seafood.  This is especially the case withV. parahaemolyticusandV. vulnificus.  Shellfish, such as oysters (Figure 4), are amongst the most common seafood found as the vehicle of transmission.  WithV. cholera, food is much less important as it is primarily waterborne.  Causes of food borne transmission have been reported, presumably from use of contaminated water in food preparation, such as in rice or salads.Figure 4: Oysters are one of the most common causes ofVibrio parahaemolyticusinfection.Disease symptoms vary considerably, from life threatening cholera (V. cholera) to self-limiting gastroenteritis (V. paraheomlyticus).  WithV. vulnificus, a septicaemia (Figure 5) is common.Figure 5:Vibrio vulnificussepticaemiaHoffmann TJ, Nelson B, Darouiche R, Rosen T. Vibrio vulnificus Septicemia.Arch Intern Med.1988;148(8):1825–1827. doi:10.1001/archinte.1988.00380080097026The main toxin of the genus is the cholera toxin (CT) (Figure 6).  It attaches to the intestine via the toxin coregulated plus (TCP), another major virulence factor.  Other toxins include a Shiga-Like toxin reported for some isolates ofV. parahaemolyticus.Figure 6: Cholera toxinVibrio disease is most often intestinal, especially that which results from ingestion of the infectious bacteria (Figure 7).  However, as seen in Figure 5, extra-intestinal sites of infection are possible withV. vulnificusand are in fact typical.  Cholera is essentially an intoxication which relies heavily on the CT.  The bacterium attaches to the intestinal epithelium causing an osmotic imbalance via the CT which results in massive fluid loss (up to 20 litres per day) and rice water stools, characteristic of cholera.V. parahaemolyticusis somewhat invasive, but not as much asV. vulnificuswhich spends little time in the gastrointestinal tract and migrates to the blood.V. parahaemolyticuspathogenesis is possible because of a range of virulence factors – haemolysins, urease, along with secretion systems (two type III and two type VI).Figure 7: Primary infection sites ofVibriospp.Plaza, N., Castillo, D., Pérez-Reytor, D., Higuera, G., García, K., & Bastías, R.

Blog,blog,Importance of food safety to the food scientist / technologist,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/importance-of-food-safety-to-the-food-scientist-technologist/,"January 12, 2020","I wrote this article in 1998 as a part of the coursework requirement for my Honours research year study in food science at the then University of Ballarat (now Federation University).  Has the perspective of the importance of food safety training and continued professional development in this area changed in 22 years?  This perspective could equally apply to food spoilage/quality concerns, but the stance of food safety was taken in this report.In Victoria, an average of nearly 2 800 reported cases over the past seven years of a single bacterial species (NNDSS, 1998) whose most important line of transmission is via food, is quite a revealing statistic and highlights the importance of food microbiology. Here we are talking about that common poultry contaminant, Campylobacter, whose number of cases peaked at 3 555 two years ago (NNDSS, 1998). Although the food industry is diverse and dynamic and covers many areas, no speciﬁc discipline in food science is probably more important that food microbiology, This is because microbiology has an impact on almost every area, its presence is continually apparent and a let-up of training of other requirements in this area could have potentially catastrophic results. The role of the food scientist/technologist in food microbiology is extremely important because the outcomes deal with human lives and their safety and a break down in the vigilance in the area of food microbiology may result in an increase in the morbidity and/or mortality statistics and therefore increasing ﬁnancial losses for that company. A good description of the role of the food microbiologist is given by Adams and Moss ( 1995) who say that it is “to help assure a supply of wholesome and safe food to the consumer”.During university study, food scientists/technologists cover a range of subject areas however their training in microbiology should prove to be most valuable. This is because of the very nature of food, and how easily it can be, and in fact, is, contaminated No matter which area they are involved, the food scientist is constantly exposed to situations and problems involving microbiology and they need to how to deal with microbiological hazards in order to minimise risks to all.Although, food is not a “living” commodity, it is still has a high nutritional value and is sufﬁciently diverse to have an impact on the growth of microbiological hazards, which varies considerably, depending on a range of factors. Therefore, it is important for the food scientist/technologist to be aware of which conditions predispose to microbial contamination. Not only this, but it is also necessary to be up to date with production techniques and how these could alter the food, and possibly creating ideal conditions for microorganisms to thrive in. As bacterial cells are truly amazing biological systems, they have a remarkable ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions, even those usually considered hostile. This can most often take place through mutation, and many examples have been documented, especially of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria, even in food (Vazquez-Morenoet al., 1990, Facinelliet al., 1991, Manieet al., 1998, Kleinet al., 1998, Perretenet al., 1998). A more common and widespread example of resistance encountered in the food industry is of the tolerance to low pH”. Many instances of food-borne disease have occurred with bacteria being transmitted in acidic foods/drinks such as apple cider (Besseret al., 1993) and fermented meat (CDC, 1995).This ability of bacteria to mutate and/or habituate to changing conditions in food emphasises the need for continuing education of food scientists/technologists. If not, they will not be able to recognise potential hazards. These aims could be fulﬁlled most effective by periodical “in-house” training programs. induction and revised training programs could also cover food and personal hygiene (Adams and Moss, 1995), which are so important in the food production environment. Food scientists/technologists should also be encouraged to attend conferences and read a wide variety of journals as well as browsing food science websites. These steps would go a long way to ensuring that they are well informed of risks in the microbiology area, especially “emerging” pathogens.Emerging pathogens are those which are of increasing importance at the present time, which did not cause a signiﬁcant amount of disease before, or did a long time ago but have re—emerged as important pathogens. These are the organisms which are most iikely to “surprise” the unwary food scientist/technologist who is unaware that they are increasing in signiﬁcance as a pathogen. Examples includeVibrio vulnificusandEscherichia coli0157:H7 (Tauxe, 1997). If a food scientist/technologist is unfamiliar with current emerging pathogens, even if that organism is isolated and identiﬁed, the food might be passed as “OK”, because the presence of the organism it is not considered a risk.Standards are present in all industries and are necessary in order to maintain a consistent level of production. These standards are mostly set by governments, but sometimes companies also set their own standards. in some cases. the government could set a general guide for a standard and the industry adopts speciﬁc guidelines which will ensure those general government standards or legislation are met. Food standards and regulations vary between locations and also alter from time to time within the one state.  Due to the importance of adhering to such regulations, it is vital food scientistsltechnologists be kept up to date by their employers. As with most microbiological mishaps, violation of such standards and regulations could easily result in illness or death to consumers. This could occur if a particular combination of growth conditions were found to be especially encouraging of an emerging pathogen. The standards would be altered according to ensure such conditions are not present in foods. However, if the food scientists/technologists are not notiﬁed, they will maintain the old standard, which may result in dangerously high levels of the organism present after production.Microbiological hazards are unpredictably severe and are an all too common occurrence in food. Since it is virtually impossible to eliminate microorganisms from food, it is the responsibility of food scientists/technologists to minimise these risks as much as possible. This is best achieved by company training as well as self-learning of the potential hazards, for example through casual reading of books and journals. This can be only done however, if the food scientist/technologist is dedicated to ensuring the highest quality (contaminant free) food, and if they are, then this is what makes a good food scientist/technologist.ReferencesAdams, M. & Moss, M.

Blog,blog,Effectiveness of hand washing,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/effectiveness-of-hand-washing/,"December 31, 2019","Did you wash your hands today?  For example, after using the toilet or before eating?  I’m sure you did, yeah?  Now, do you actually know why you washed your hands?  Why is it important to have clean hands?  Sometimes we do certain actions, which are second nature to us, without necessary thinking why – we know it is important, or so the “experts” say, but we may not know why.  Well, in this case, we wash our hands to eliminate any pathogenic (disease-causing) microorganisms that may be present, which is a high probability after using the toilet and to reduce the possibility of foodborne disease, we wash again before eating.  The humble act of hand-washing to ensure clean hands is still one of the most effective acts of personal hygiene, as it was when Joseph Lister suggested the importance of clean hands during surgery, in his ground-breaking work carried out in a Glasgow hospital in the 1860s.While clean hands and the importance of personal hygiene is commonplace today and generally understood, it of course wasn’t always like this.  For much of history, the world held to the Miasma theory of disease (Figure 1).  This arose around 250 and was the only school of thought for the transmission of infectious disease for much of history.  The Miasma theory of disease is based on the idea that bad air, foul smells, stenches and the like, cause disease, especially at night.  Therefore, hospital wards used to be aired in the middle of the day and in some places, people would be wary of venturing out at night and would stay indoors with all windows closed.Figure 1: Representation of the Miasma theory of diseaseFigure 2: Joseph ListerIn the mid-1500s, the first suggestion that particular entities, what we now know as microorganisms, may cause disease was postulated.  However, the first compelling evidence for this germ theory of disease came over three centuries later, with the above-mentioned work in Glasgow of Joseph Lister (Figure 2).  Lister read of the pioneering work of French microbiologist and chemist, Louis Pasteur (inventor of pasteurisation – one of the most common heat processing methods for all kinds of foods), and decided to try some of the ideas Pasteur put forward.  One was the use of a chemical antiseptic, in this case phenol, in the surgical wards and on the hands of surgeons and other staff to ensure clean (disinfected) hands.  The results were astounding – there was a dramatic decrease in the incidence of infections and death in the hospital wards where the tests were carried out.  This work was a turning point in hygiene and the use of antiseptics and was published in a series of papers in the reputable medical journal – The Lancet.  The year was 1869.  This convincing evidence for the benefits of clean hands spread first to France and Germany and then throughout Europe.  Thus, in the 1870s, Europe had accepted this germ theory of disease as the means for the spread of infection and therefore, accepted also, the idea that disinfecting hands could stop infectious disease transmission.Figure 3: James GarfieldHowever, across the Atlantic, it was a different story – the Americans were steadfast in their belief for the Miasma theory, that bad air caused disease.  This was all to change in the 1880s however.  In early July of 1881, James Garfield (Figure 3), 20th President of the United States was about to set off on his summer holiday, by train, from Washington, D.C..  He was to travel to the New England region, and was set to deliver a talk at his alma mater, Williams College in Williamstown, MA.  All went horribly wrong when he arrived at the station – as he was walking through the station waiting room, he was gunned down from behind.  As bad as this was, the events that unfolded immediately after the shooting and until his death were worse.  The President collapsed to the floor, and the first medical staff on hand had only one objective – to find the bullet.  Thus, they set to work on trying to locate it, but the main problem was, they were ignorant to the germ theory of disease and had no regard for personal hygiene.  Therefore, they probed the President’s wound with their bare, non-disinfected fingers and non-sterile instruments – one physician even put his whole hand into the President’s wound, right up to his wrist!  Over the next two and a half months or so of the President’s apparent convalescence, around 12-15 doctors poked and prodded and probed the President’s wounds, each and every time with non-sterile instruments and/or unclean hands.  This, no doubt, introduced untold numbers of microorganisms into the wound and slowly, infection after infection took hold.  Eventually, in the third week of September, the President’s ultimate demise took place, when he died at a seaside hamlet.  Thus, there is no doubt that the would-be assassin did shoot President Garfield, however, the shooting did not kill him.  The actions of the medical team and their ignorance of the germ theory of disease and therefore their inability to wash their hands were the actions that killed the President.  The death of James Garfield in 1881, the 20th President of the United States, is one of the biggest medical blunders of all time and remains one of the most significant incidents of medical malpractice in history.Hand-washing, which gives clean hands, can prevent the spread of infectious microorganisms and thus can eliminate the spread of infectious disease.  It is a simple, quick action (Figure 4) that has significant benefits.  Please wash your hands after using the toilet, before eating and be particularly strict with hand-washing during food preparation.  Your life and the life of your loved ones could depend on it.Figure 4: Correct hand-washing procedure","food microbiology, Food safety, hand washing, miasma theory, personal hygiene"
Blog,blog,Be safe with food,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/be-safe-with-food/,"December 26, 2019","This post was originally published on 26 October 2016 on a previous blog of mine, Agrifood Research Central.  Here we have a slight revision and a republishing.We all have the right to access food that is safe to eat – but is that all there is to the story? How proactive are we in ensuring the safety of food that we handle ourselves? Once upon a time, the food manufacturing industry was rife with unsafe practices, resulting in substances, today known as toxic, added intentionally to food to serve various purposes. This was 19th century England where various copper, lead and mercury compounds, for example, would be added.Today, in many countries, strict regulations govern food production and manufacturing in addition to food service, and thus the likelihood of acquiring a foodborne disease outside of the home is remote. Food manufacturing operations apply a quality assurance type of approach, through the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) concept (Figure 1) which maintains very strict conditions of safe manufacture according to local and international standards. From a purely business perspective, it can be devastating indeed to a food manufacturing business to have recalled products due to a safety issue or worse, have consumer morbidity or mortality. Such a situation could collapse a business and be so severe that it cannot rise from such a crippling effect of consumer mistrust. Therefore, food companies are extremely strict in how they conduct their manufacturing operations and in their adherence to the Food Standards Code, or international equivalent.Figure 1: Overview of HACCPIncreasingly, the largest danger with regard to food safety, is right in our own kitchen, where many dangers lurk.  These pathogenic (disease-causing) microorganisms are waiting to inflict illness on us and our families if you do not exercise the appropriate food safety precautions. For example, the temperature danger zone (Figure 2) and cross contamination (Figure 3) are critical concepts that domestic food handlers must be mindful of, so as to ensure foodborne disease risks are kept at an absolute minimum. People generally know that meat poses the highest foodborne disease risks, but how many people know that rice poses a similar risk?  It is not uncommon for people to pack rice meals for lunch and keep them at room temperature from the time they leave home in the morning until lunchtime – that is taking a huge risk, as even small numbers of pathogenic microorganisms could reach extreme numbers by the middle of the day, if the food is kept in the temperature ‘danger zone’.Figure 2: Temperature danger zoneFigure 3: The principle of cross-contaminationHow about the ‘five second rule”? Another food safety myth – microorganisms are everywhere and going to attach to food in an instant, they have no concept of time and waiting for five seconds before they ‘latch’ on to a piece of fallen food!  Check out my video below to understand more:Another area of food safety where there is much discussion and debate is food additives. Are they bad? Are they ok? Can we trust the government in our own country to regulate their use? Why are some banned in some countries but not in others? One aspect is certain – food manufacturers only put into food what we want in our food. Then you might say, “Hey, I don’t want this additive and that additive with all those E numbers and long names I can’t pronounce!” Sure, you might not want a particular additive in your food, but do you know what that additive does? Are you prepared to make a sacrifice for giving up that additive? You might be thinking, “Come on, these food companies are just piling in the additives to cover something up or to somehow increase their profits”. Well consider this – the reason you can buy a jam with consistent texture each time is the pectin that is added. If you are a home jam maker, you’ll appreciate the benefit of using pectin to ensure a consistently gelling product each time, after all, who wants runny jam (Figure 4) that is going to flow right off your toast as soon as you pick it up! Maybe you’re not concerned about pectin, a plant-based gelling agent found in the skins of fruits, but say, red food colouring. Well, ok, eliminate the red food dye – then, would you or your children really drink strawberry flavoured milk that is white? This is just one example, but it shows the various characteristics of food and drink we have come to expect. Food additives are used in everything from shelf-life extension to giving food the colour we expect, the flavour we expect and appropriate textures too – in short, we can’t do without them with our current range of foods. However, if we are willing to change our expectations on quality, lower our expectations on consistency and in fact change our perception of what is “normal” for a given food product, then we could eliminate food additives. As stated earlier, food companies give us what we want because they need to make money by selling us something that we are going to buy. If we don’t like something in a product, then buy an alternative. If no alternative exists, then make your own and maybe, they could be a market out there to up-scale your home innovation to industrial scale. If enough people stop buying a product, then the food company will have no choice but to drop that line, it is that simple. They cannot continue producing an item that is not popular, and therefore profitable.Figure 4: Runny jamThere are many facets to food safety, however, one thing is clear – by and large, we are in control of the safety of the foods we consume.  The domestic kitchen tends to be less safe than commercial kitchens, so please be mindful during food preparation and cleaning at home.  Manufactured food products may legally contain some ingredients that we are not too keen on.  However, from a safety point of view all additives are fine for the general population and it is really only particular minority groups that need to keep tabs on what they consume.","5 second rule, cook clean chill separate, cross contamination, food additives, Food quality, Food safety, HACCP, pectin"

Commentry,commentry,Our first two years,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/our-first-two-years/,"January 1, 2022","A message from our Academy Director & Head of Research:Just over two years since Food Microbiology Academy was established, on 14 December 2019.  Our original vision was to be an independent research institute, with a supporting teaching program.  With this in mind, and with no funding for research, we commenced consulting and extension services, for the global food manufacturing industry.  We quickly started working with clients in Europe, North America and locally here in Australia, over our first few months.  Much of this initial work was in the area of shelf-life optimisation and extension, troubleshooting industry quality issues and extending shelf-life for export products, for example.  Within half a year we recognised that more opportunities existed in the area of food new product development (NPD).  In the middle of 2020, we commenced our first projects in this area.  With more clients and our first products nearing completion towards the end of 2020, we made the choice to separate the food NPD activities into a separate organisation, Food Entrepreneurship Academy, co-founded by Mr Naishad Dalal and Dr Philip Button in January of 2021.  During 2021, Food Microbiology Academy handled consulting projects in the shelf-life determination, optimisation and extension area.  As we approach 2022, Food Microbiology Academy is looking at a slight pivot, returning to a clearer direction towards our original vision if you like, with our (food microbiology) consulting and extension activities migrating to Food Entrepreneurship Academy.  This leaves the Food Microbiology Academy with more freedom to pursue it’s original vision, with a focus on research, supporting by a teaching program.  To this end, our focus in 2022 will be research.  Research as an independent and non-affiliated institute, led by Dr Philip Button (speaking in our video below), as our Academy Director and Head of Research.  While we have some older projects to finish up, our first research project to be established will be food safety on cooking shows, as outlined below.  Thus, Food Microbiology Academy will be starting 2022 as a dedicated, independent and non-affiliated research institute for food microbiology.

Since 2013, I have maintained involvement with universities, although not necessarily in the research space.  What I will describe below pertains to the traditional and typical research cycle in an academic environment.  However, the research scene is changing, and one could say is really being shaken-up by the entry and rise of crowdfunding not too many years ago.  While it started slowly, it has certainly gained traction in recent years as a legitimate source of research funds, with numerous universities seeking research funding through such channels.  While it doesn’t have the prestige of the high-level nationally or internationally competitive grant funding schemes, many small projects have been funded through crowdfunding, whether it be seeding to generate some proof-of-concept results, or for undergraduate students projects.  Either way, or for other reasons, universities and others, are turning to and exploring crowdfunding as a way to further their research agendas.  While we shall not go into crowdfunding any further here, it is an area that needs to be seriously considered, and included, I believe, in the range of options that researchers pursue for external funding.To secure funding, particularly external Category 1 funding on the former Australian Competitive Grants Register, it is a must ultimately, to have an understanding of national research priorities, as advised by the federal government.  Once an understanding is gained of these, then usually an understanding is gained of research priorities at all lower levels, so at state, local and institutional level.  However, each lower level has a specific focus, but this focus must align within part of the national research agenda, as set by the federal government.  Thus, it pays to be fully aware that each level of a university (department, school, faculty) has their own research priority and that these need to be matched with the (changing) research priorities of a funding or industry body, in order to maximise the chances of a successful application.When assisting with compiling grant applications, and hence learning the process, it pays to become fully aware of strategies used to maximise success.  One of the most important strategies, where permitted by the funding body, is to actually contact the research manager responsible for that particularly program that you intend to submit to and discuss your proposed application with them.  This can give very competitive insights into how to give your application an edge over others.  For larger funding schemes where this may not be possible, such as ARC, it is advisable to study closely previous successes.  In particular, it would be considered important to the minimum requirements in key areas (such as in-kind, but more importantly cash contributions) to be exceeded, in relation to the funding request from the Commonwealth.Since essentially, all of the research I’ve undertaken has been in the university environment, I have an extensive knowledge of the higher education research process and as I have been a university-based researcher, I completely understand the needs and nature of researchers at universities.  For example, I understand the need to obtain funding to pay for consumables and research staff/students to undertake the research and that there are a few selected schemes which are usually most appropriate for a given academic, based on their research interests.  Very few schemes accept applications at any time, and therefore it is normally the case that academic and research administrators would be very busy during particular periods of the year, especially during the deadline period for major funding schemes, such as those of the ARC and NHMRC.  Furthermore, as I have liased with different research administrators (financial, contractual, business development and others) over the years and therefore understand the financial and contractual requirements when setting up a project.  As a result, I understand the complete research cycle in a university, as outlined below:Formulate the research ideaDiscuss the research idea with the funding body if possibleResearch through the Internet or elsewhere about specific strategies to maximise success in that particular funding scheme.Attend workshops if necessary to learn about that particular funding scheme and how to maximise successWrite the (preliminary) applicationSubmit the application to the university’s research office for checking, feedback and approvals.If a preliminary application, it may be rejected or you may be asked to submit a full applicationIf not a preliminary application, there may be an opportunity to respond to preliminary feedback, such as the ARC rejoinder process.Should the application be successful, a contractual research agreement showing expectations, budget, intellectual property and other aspects needs to be signed by the funding body and the university.An account is then opened and the funding body is issued an invoice for that first payment.If you want to know more about how I can work with you on your grant application, to maximise your chances of success, please do get in touch – Dr Philip Button … philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academy","research funding, research grants, research project"
Commentry,"commentry, food-safety, history",The rule of microorganisms,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-rule-of-microorganisms/,"February 2, 2020","We are in a state of society or human civilisation where we are advancing faster than ever before – our creativity, our innovation and our progress seem to be boundless and what wasn’t even a thought not long ago is well on the to becoming reality (Figure 1).Figure 1: Human progress over the last 200 years.Take the last 50 years, back to 1970.  The difference in so many facets of the world is so vastly different between 1970 and 2020.  The same can’t be said for the progress made between 1870 and 1920, let alone say between 1370 an 1420.  With new fields of study and new professions rapidly emerging, society is advancing at an unprecedented rate.  Driverless cars, drones, artificial intelligence and 5G are revolutionising our world.  Despite these seemingly boundless gains in so many areas of human endeavour, we are in the midst of yet another disease pandemic.  Not “just another” pandemic, but a global pandemic (Figure 2), a global pandemic so serious that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current coronavirus pandemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (Figure 3).Figure 2: Global cases of the 2019-nCoV virus as of at 08:00 UTC on 1 February 2020.Figure 3: The 2019-nCoV global pandemic is a Public Health Emergency of International ConcernAs a global community, humankind can achieve so much and conquer nearly anything, it seems.  However, we are brought to our knees by a virus of just 100 nm in size, which converts to 0.0001 mm, which is unimaginably small.Figure 4: Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the 2019-nCoV virus.A virus, which like all viruses, lacks the ability to grow and replicate outside of a host cell – they hijack, if you like, the metabolic machinery of their host cell, which thus changes from maintaining and growing the host cell to simply growing and replicating new virus particles, or virions as they are called (Figure 5).Figure 5: The life of viruses.This all means viruses are not considered living and thus they are not considered lifeforms, because they don’t fulfil the basic criteria of life (Figure 6).  So, get your head around this, an entity that doesn’t fulfil the criteria to be called a form of life is striking fear into humanity, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality and crippling the economy, quite possibly the global economy.Figure 6: Requirements for life.As of 31 January 2020, Sarah Knapton reports in the Telegraph (1) that epidemiological modelling by The University of Hong Kong say around 75 000 people are estimated to be infected in Wuhan alone, with the size of the pandemic doubling every six days.  As of yesterday, 259 people are believed to have died from the infection with nearly 12 000 infected, officially, report Yeung and George on CNN (2).  The interesting aspect to consider, and what I really want to point out here is that disease epidemics and even global pandemics have been occurring for centuries (Figure 7).Figure 7: Just a handful of the epidemics and pandemics of the world.While the significance of the eradication of smallpox cannot be understated, especially considering that an estimated 500 million died from it between 1877 and the last known case in 1977, it seems that there are always diseases out there almost waiting to take the place of those which diminish in number of cases, or are eradicated, in the case of smallpox.  Like Spanish Flu, caused by an H1N1 influenza virus, killed between an estimated 50 000 000 and 100 000 000 between 1918 and 1920 or what is probably the most famous epidemic in history, the Black Death, caused byYersinia pestis, which killed an estimated 75 000 000 to 200 000 000 people between 1331 and 1353.  Even with recent foodborne diseases, there are still “records” being broken.  For example, theListeria monocytogenesoutbreak of 2017 and 2018 in South Africa was the largest in history, anywhere in the world, with 1 060 infected and 216 deaths.  Even cholera outbreaks continue to occur, and have been occurring for hundreds of years – the most recent and still ongoing is in Yemen where close to 4 000 people have died and around 1 200 000 cases reported since 2016.  Figure 8 shows the impact as of October 2017.Figure 8: Status of cholera in Yemen as of October 2017.Bacteria, or microorganisms that are not even living (viruses) have decimated humanity over millennia, and continue to do so.  All this, while we can do more in the current age than ever before, we are the most advanced, have made the most progress and an unprecedented rate is recent times, yet, infectious diseases still kill, and kill in such significance.  Why is it that non-living entities can have such sustained and significant impacts over the the most “superior” of all lifeforms, such an impact that humankind cannot conquer, as wave after wave of infectious diseases sweep the planet.  No doubt an interesting point to ponder.  Does that make microbiology the most important of all human endeavours?  Does that make microbiology worthy of increased attention?  Does that make microbiology worthy of increased resources?  If one wants to save the world, then the microbial world is a good place to start, and dare I say it, to end – such is the significance of microbiology to society and humankind, that maybe most (is it too bold to say all?) the problems of the world can be addressed and solved through microbiology.   So yes, who rules the world? People or microorganisms?  I’ll leave you with that thought.Referenceshttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/01/31/coronavirus-75000-people-infected-wuhan-experts-now-believe/https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-01-20-intl-hnk/index.html","coronaviridae, coronavirus, epidemic, food microbiology, microbiology, pandemic, pheic, virology"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, food-quality, fungi, yeast",From HPP Innovation Week – Part 2,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/from-hpp-innovation-week-part-2/,"July 5, 2024","This is the second of a two-part series of overview blog articles written byChloe Lam(chloe.lam@foodmicrobiology.academy), who attended the HPP Innovation Week session from 18-20 June 2024.Food safety controlRegarding risk analysis for ensuring food safety in food production, HPP has a role in controlling biological hazards (i.e. pathogens). By modifying HPP parameters including pressure, holding time, and water temperature, HPP can be integrated into HACCP plans as the critical control point. According to @Mario González, Ph.d. | HPP Applications Manager at Hiperbaric, HPP even has the potential to reduce the allergenicity of certain foods and reduce the concentration of mycotoxin.HPP can be used to facilitate hazard control in food products. It can be used in controlling the pathogenic microbial concentration. In terms of bacterial inactivation, HPP helps meeting the performance criterion of > 3log reduction of bacteria level established by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference. The limitation of spoilage microorganisms can minimize the formation of TMA, which lowers the risk of food poisoning. Besides, the HPP technique can facilitate the elimination of parasites. Mild HPP conditions for around 180 seconds can completely inactivate parasites from raw fish fillets. The use of mild HPP conditions not only can eliminate parasites, but also minimize the impact on quality.HPP is a versatile nonthermal food preservation technique that inactive pathogens while maintaining sensory and nutritional qualities. The implementation of HPP allows for avoiding product recalls and market withdrawals associated with biological hazards.Application in various productsMultiple researches have been conducted on various food products, including craft beer, cold brew coffee, durian, and seafood. All showed an extended reduction of spoilage bacteria levels after HPP. Unlike thermal pasteurization, HPP maintains the stability of products and does not change the quality profile of food.Taking craft beer as an illustrative example, HPP has a growing market in this field, driven by the increasing popularity and demand.  This technology can extend the shelf-life of products without the need for heating or the addition of preservatives. Even though pasteurization can effectively prevent microbial growth, it would also induce unfavorable alterations such as accelerated aging and developing a stale flavor. Notably, a significant reduction of spoilage bacteria (3.1log) is maintained throughout the product’s shelf-life (@Rui Queirós, Ph.d. | HPP Applications Specialist at Hiperbaric).On the flip side, HPP also proves highly advantageous in preserving the quality of craft beer. It can retain the quality of craft beer without altering sensory attributes, color, and alcohol content. Customers are unable to distinguish HPP-treated beer from untreated samples in sensory tests, indicating the process preserves the intended flavor profile. This highlights HPP’s suitability for maintaining the authentic taste and sensory characteristics of products, avoiding the quality degradation that can occur with heat-based treatments.Overall, the versatility of HPP technology is illustrated where it can extend shelf-life and preserve the inherent sensory qualities that consumers demand, without compromising the integrity of the final product.SummaryHigh Pressure Processing (HPP) is an innovative nonthermal food preservation technology that is transforming the food industry. By using high hydrostatic pressure, HPP can inactivate harmful microorganisms and extend the shelf-life of a wide range of food products, from meat and seafood to beverages and dips, while preserving their natural flavors, nutrients, and appearance. Compared to traditional thermal pasteurisation, HPP offers significant advantages, including the ability to create “clean label” foods with minimal additives, improve visual appeal, and facilitate more efficient and higher-yielding extraction of shellfish meat. With a rapidly growing global market, HPP is well-positioned to address consumer demand for minimally processed, safe, and high-quality foods.","food industry, food manufacturing, food microbiology, food preservation, food processing, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, fungi, yeast",Good health from fermented dairy products,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/good-health-from-fermented-dairy-products/,"July 1, 2023","This month we’ve featured fermented goods in a big way – this is the third and final post to showcase the diversity of fermented foods across the world.  This article is about dairy products, where we feature a couple of examples in detail.  To start with, here are some unusual and different fermented dairy products from around the world:Skyr: A traditional Icelandic dairy product that resembles yogurt but has a thicker, creamier consistency. It is made from skim milk and is high in protein.Filmjölk: A fermented milk product from Sweden, similar to yogurt but with a thinner consistency. It has a slightly sour taste and is often enjoyed with fruits or muesli.Kefir: A fermented milk drink that originated in the Caucasus region. It is made by fermenting milk with kefir grains, which are a combination of bacteria and yeast. Kefir has a tangy taste and a slightly effervescent texture.Kumis: A traditional fermented dairy product from Central Asia, particularly popular in Mongolia. It is made from fermented mare’s milk and has a slightly sour and fizzy taste.Tarhana: A dried fermented dairy product found in various forms across the Middle East, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe. It is made from a mixture of fermented milk, wheat flour, and vegetables, and is often used to make soups.Dadih: A traditional Indonesian fermented buffalo milk product. It is made by coagulating the milk with a local wild grass called “elephantopus,” resulting in a custard-like texture and a tangy flavor.Clabber: A traditional Southern United States dairy product made by allowing raw milk to naturally ferment and sour. It has a thick consistency and is often used as a base for cooking or eaten with sweeteners.Suutei Tsai: A Mongolian traditional tea made with fermented milk. It is prepared by boiling green tea with milk and allowing it to ferment, resulting in a unique and tangy beverage.Amasi: A fermented milk product from Southern Africa, also known as maas. It is similar to yogurt but has a thicker consistency and a slightly sour taste.Chal: A fermented dairy product from Iran, particularly in the Gilan and Mazandaran provinces. It is made by fermenting raw cow’s milk and has a thick texture and tangy flavor.Photo by Pixabay onPexels.comSuutei Tsai,also known as Suutei Tsai, is a traditional Mongolian tea made with milk and served as a popular beverage in Mongolia. It is prepared by boiling green tea with milk, resulting in a unique and distinct flavor.The name “Suutei Tsai” translates to “milk tea” in Mongolian, reflecting its main ingredients and preparation method. The tea is typically made using a specific type of green tea leaves called “brick tea,” which are pressed into compact blocks and stored for aging before use.To make Suutei Tsai, the brick tea leaves are first broken into smaller pieces and then boiled in water. The tea is simmered for an extended period to extract the flavors from the leaves fully. During this process, the tea develops a robust and slightly bitter taste.After the tea is brewed, milk is added to create a creamy and rich texture. The amount of milk used can vary based on personal preference and regional variations. Some recipes call for equal parts tea and milk, while others use a higher ratio of milk to tea.Suutei Tsai is often sweetened with salt or sometimes with sugar or butter, depending on personal preference. The addition of salt is a unique characteristic of Mongolian milk tea, giving it a slightly savory taste that distinguishes it from other milk teas found in different cultures.This tea holds significant cultural importance in Mongolia and is commonly consumed throughout the day, particularly during meals or social gatherings. It serves as a warming and comforting beverage in the cold climate of Mongolia and is believed to have various health benefits, including aiding digestion and providing energy.Suutei Tsai represents the fusion of Mongolian nomadic traditions and the influence of neighboring cultures. It has become an integral part of Mongolian cuisine and cultural identity, offering a distinct and delightful tea-drinking experience.Clabber is a traditional dairy product that has been consumed for centuries, particularly in rural and farming communities. It is a type of milk that has naturally soured and thickened due to the activity of lactic acid bacteria. Clabber is often associated with Southern United States cuisine, where it has been a staple for generations.The process of making clabber is relatively simple. Fresh raw milk is left at room temperature for an extended period, typically overnight or up to 24 hours. During this time, naturally occurring bacteria in the milk convert lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid through the process of fermentation. This fermentation results in the milk thickening and developing a tangy, slightly sour taste.The texture and consistency of clabber can vary, depending on factors such as the temperature and the specific bacteria present. It can range from a slightly thickened milk to a custard-like consistency. The flavor is typically tart and tangy, similar to yogurt or buttermilk.Clabber can be consumed as is or used as an ingredient in various dishes. It is often enjoyed as a stand-alone food or served with sweeteners such as honey or sugar. It can also be used as a base for cooking, where it adds a tangy flavor to recipes like pancakes, biscuits, or cornbread.It’s worth noting that the production of clabber involves raw milk, which may contain harmful bacteria. Therefore, it’s important to ensure the milk comes from a safe and trusted source. In modern times, pasteurized milk is often used to make clabber as a safer alternative.Clabber represents a traditional and simple form of dairy fermentation, preserving milk while providing a tangy and distinctive flavor. It showcases the natural transformative power of bacteria and demonstrates how simple culinary techniques can create unique and culturally significant foods.Photo by Matthias Zomer onPexels.com","fermentation, food microbiology, food science, healthy eating, microbiology, probiotics"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, food-quality, fungi, viruses, yeast",50 facts about food microbiology!,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/50-facts-about-food-microbiology/,"June 26, 2023","Food microbiology is the study of microorganisms that interact with food, including bacteria, viruses, yeasts, molds, and parasites.Microorganisms can be both beneficial and harmful to food. Beneficial microorganisms are used in processes like fermentation and production of certain foods, while harmful microorganisms can cause foodborne illnesses.Bacteria are the most common microorganisms associated with food spoilage and foodborne diseases.Some common bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses includeSalmonella,Escherichiacoli(E. coli),Listeriamonocytogenes, andCampylobacter.Viruses, such as Norovirus and Hepatitis A, can also contaminate food and cause foodborne illnesses.Yeasts and molds are responsible for food spoilage and can affect the texture, flavor, and appearance of food.Microorganisms can contaminate food at various stages, including during production, processing, transportation, and storage.Foodborne illnesses can result from consuming contaminated raw or undercooked food, improper food handling and preparation, cross-contamination, and inadequate storage temperatures.Temperature control is crucial in preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms. The temperature danger zone for food is between 4 °C (40 °F) and 60 °C (140°F).Pasteurisation is a process that involves heating food to a specific temperature to kill or inactivate harmful microorganisms, while retaining the food’s quality.Fermentation is a process that uses beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, to convert sugars into alcohol or acids. Examples include yogurt, cheese, sauerkraut, and pickles.Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, provide health benefits. They are often found in fermented foods and are known to promote gut health.Food preservation techniques, such as canning, drying, and freezing, aim to prevent or slow down the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.Good hygiene practices, including proper handwashing, cleaning and sanitizing of surfaces, and maintaining personal hygiene, are essential in preventing the spread of microorganisms in food.Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a systematic approach used in the food industry to identify and control potential hazards related to food safety.Foodborne illnesses can have various symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and in severe cases, organ failure or death.Proper cooking temperatures are critical to ensure the elimination of harmful microorganisms. For example, poultry should reach an internal temperature of 74 °C (165 °F), while ground meat should reach 71 °C (160 °F).Cross-contamination can occur when raw foods come into contact with cooked or ready-to-eat foods, potentially transferring harmful microorganisms. Separate cutting boards and utensils should be used for raw and ready-to-eat foods.Some food products undergo a process called aseptic packaging, which involves sterilizing the food and packaging materials separately and then filling the sterile food into sterile containers.The pH level of a food product can influence the growth of microorganisms. Most bacteria prefer a neutral pH around 7, while some acid-tolerant bacteria can grow in low-pH environments.Food poisoning is a type of foodborne illness caused by the ingestion of toxins produced by certain bacteria, such asStaphylococcusaureusandBacilluscereus.Food intoxication occurs when the ingestion of food contaminated with live microorganisms leads to illness. Examples includeSalmonellaandCampylobacterinfections.Food allergies are immune responses triggered by specific proteins in food. They are not caused by microorganisms but can be influenced by cross-contamination or improper labeling.Botulism is a severe form of food poisoning caused by the toxin produced by the bacteriumClostridiumbotulinum. It can result from improperly canned or preserved foods.Fermented dairy products, such as yogurt and kefir, contain beneficial bacteria known as probiotics, which can contribute to a healthy gut microbiome.The use of antibiotics in livestock can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can potentially be transmitted to humans through contaminated food.The development of rapid diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing, has revolutionised the detection and identification of microorganisms in food.Food microbiologists often work closely with food scientists, food safety experts, and regulatory agencies to ensure the safety and quality of food products.Food recalls can occur when a product is found to be contaminated with harmful microorganisms or other hazards. They are initiated to protect public health.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, are used in the production of alcoholic beverages through the process of fermentation.Foodborne pathogens can survive and multiply in refrigerated environments, emphasising the importance of proper storage temperatures and practices.Cross-protective adaptations can occur between different microorganisms in food, where the presence of one microorganism inhibits the growth of another.Food fermentation can enhance the nutritional value of foods by increasing the availability of certain vitamins and minerals.Some moulds produce mycotoxins, which are toxic compounds that can contaminate food. Examples include aflatoxins, produced byAspergillusmolds, which can be found in nuts, grains, and spices.Biopreservation is a technique that uses naturally occurring microorganisms or their products to inhibit the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in food.The microbial composition of food can vary depending on factors such as the source of the food, processing methods, and storage conditions.Some beneficial bacteria, such as those in the genusLactobacillusandBifidobacterium, are commonly used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products.Foodborne illness outbreaks can occur when multiple people experience similar symptoms after consuming contaminated food from a common source.Food safety regulations and guidelines differ among countries and are often based on risk assessments and scientific evidence.The use of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) is being explored as a potential alternative to antibiotics for controlling bacterial pathogens in food.Some microorganisms, such as those in the genusSaccharomyces, are used in bread making and contribute to the fermentation process, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and alcohol.High-pressure processing (HPP) is a non-thermal food preservation technique that uses high pressure to inactivate microorganisms while retaining the nutritional value and quality of food.Microorganisms can form biofilms on food contact surfaces, making them more resistant to cleaning and sanitising agents.The presence of certain microorganisms, such asPseudomonasspp., can accelerate the spoilage of fresh produce.Foodborne illnesses can have significant economic impacts, including medical costs, loss of productivity, and damage to the reputation of food manufacturers.The study of foodborne pathogens and their transmission routes is essential for developing effective control strategies to prevent foodborne illnesses.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, can produce enzymes that enhance the flavor and texture of food products.Food safety training and education are vital for food handlers and consumers to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure proper food handling practices.Microbial testing is commonly used in the food industry to monitor the quality and safety of food products.Ongoing research in food microbiology aims to develop novel methods for microbial control, improve food preservation techniques, and enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and food.","food microbiologist, food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, fungi, yeast",Fermented vegetables for health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/fermented-vegetables-for-health/,"June 21, 2023","Tsukemonois a traditional Japanese term that refers to a variety of pickled vegetables. It is a popular side dish and condiment in Japanese cuisine, often served alongside meals to provide a balance of flavors and textures. Tsukemono can range from simple salted pickles to more complex, seasoned and fermented varieties.The process of making tsukemono typically involves preserving vegetables in a brine or salt to extract moisture and promote fermentation. This fermentation process can vary in duration, from a few hours to several months, depending on the desired flavor and texture. The brine or salt mixture may also contain additional seasonings like rice bran, vinegar, soy sauce, miso, or spices to impart different flavors.There are numerous types of tsukemono, each with its unique taste and characteristics. Some common examples include:Shibazuke: A popular tsukemono from Kyoto, made with cucumbers, eggplant, ginger, and perilla leaves, fermented in a sweet and sour purple-red brine.Takuan: Yellow pickled daikon radish, often sliced and served as a crunchy and slightly sweet accompaniment to rice or sushi.Umeboshi: Pickled Japanese plums that are salty, tangy, and sour in taste. They are commonly enjoyed as a condiment or added to rice balls (onigiri).Gari: Sweet and tangy pickled ginger often served with sushi to cleanse the palate between bites.Asazuke: Quick-pickled vegetables that are lightly salted and usually left to marinate for a short time, resulting in a crunchy texture and a refreshing flavor.Fukujinzuke: A mixed vegetable pickle typically used as a condiment for Japanese curry. It consists of various vegetables like daikon, lotus root, and cucumber, pickled in a soy-based sauce.Tsukemono can vary in taste, texture, and appearance depending on the region, ingredients, and preparation methods. They add a vibrant and refreshing element to Japanese meals, providing a balance of flavors to complement the main dishes.Escabecheis a traditional dish and cooking technique that has roots in Spanish cuisine but is also prevalent in Latin American, Filipino, and Mediterranean cuisines. The term “escabeche” refers to a method of preserving and flavoring food by marinating it in a vinegar-based sauce or marinade.In its most common form, escabeche typically involves fish or meat that is first cooked, then immersed in a marinade composed of vinegar, oil, onions, garlic, and various herbs and spices. The dish is then left to marinate for a period of time, allowing the flavors to meld together and the protein to absorb the tangy and aromatic characteristics of the marinade.The marinade used in escabeche can vary depending on the regional and cultural influences. Some common ingredients used in the marinade include:Vinegar: The primary acidic component of escabeche, vinegar provides the distinctive tangy flavor and acts as a preservative.Oil: Usually olive oil or vegetable oil, which adds richness and helps balance the acidity of the vinegar.Onions: Thinly sliced onions are often a key component of the marinade, imparting a sweet and savory flavor.Garlic: Crushed or minced garlic cloves are frequently added to enhance the overall flavor profile.Herbs and Spices: Bay leaves, oregano, thyme, peppercorns, and chili peppers are commonly used to season the marinade and add aromatic and spicy notes.The marinated protein, whether fish or meat, is typically served cold or at room temperature. The marinade not only imparts flavor but also acts as a preservative, allowing the dish to be enjoyed over an extended period. It is common to find escabeche served as an appetizer, a side dish, or even as a main course, accompanied by rice, bread, or other side dishes.Escabeche can be versatile, with variations in different regions and cultures. For example, in the Philippines, it is often made with fried fish and served as a popular dish called “escabeche de pescado.”Overall, escabeche offers a unique blend of flavors, combining the acidity of the vinegar, the richness of the oil, and the aromatic herbs and spices. It provides a tangy and savory addition to the culinary landscape.Pickled watermelon rindis a unique and flavorful food product made from the rind or peel of watermelon, which is typically discarded. Instead of being wasted, the rind is preserved and transformed into a tangy and sweet pickled delicacy.The process of making pickled watermelon rind involves removing the green outer skin and any remaining pink flesh from the watermelon rind. The rind is then typically cut into bite-sized pieces or strips, although shapes can vary depending on personal preference and regional traditions.The rind is then soaked in a brine solution containing vinegar, sugar, and various spices and seasonings. The brine helps to impart flavor, preserve the rind, and balance the natural sweetness with acidity. Commonly used spices and seasonings include cinnamon, cloves, ginger, allspice, and sometimes chili peppers for a touch of heat.After soaking in the brine for a period of time, which can range from a few days to several weeks, the watermelon rind absorbs the flavors and undergoes a transformation. The result is a pickled watermelon rind with a firm yet tender texture and a sweet and tangy taste profile. The rind retains some of its natural sweetness while being infused with the flavors of the brine and spices.Pickled watermelon rind is often enjoyed as a snack or side dish. It can be eaten on its own or paired with other foods like cheese or cured meats. In some regions, it is also used as a condiment or relish, adding a unique touch to sandwiches or salads.The pickling process not only enhances the flavor and texture of the watermelon rind but also helps to extend its shelf life, allowing it to be enjoyed for an extended period. It is a delightful example of utilizing a typically discarded part of the watermelon and transforming it into a delicious and versatile culinary treat.","fermentation, food microbiology, food preservation, food science, foods of the world"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, food-safety, fungi, viruses, yeast",The Food Safety Modernization Act: Transforming Food Safety Practices in the USA,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-food-safety-modernization-act-transforming-food-safety-practices-in-the-usa/,"June 7, 2023","Today, 7 June 2023, is World Food Safety Day, a day the World Health Organisation has set aside to focus on failings in food safety and to celebrate achievements in food safety.  This year’s theme is about how food standards in food safety save lives.  There’s no doubt that they do.  When one looks back to the 19th century, even, or maybe especially, in the the great industrialised nations of the modern world, up and coming food manufacturers, either out of ignorance or deliberately, manufactured foods that were certainly not in the public’s best interests.  While we don’t have the level of morbidity and mortality we once did, there’s no doubt that foodborne disease represents a totally unacceptable high amount of illness, death and economic burden in our communities.  What makes it even more difficult to understand is that foodborne illness is largely preventable, through the following of procedures, processes and protocols that have been developed following rigorous basic scientific research.  Thus, food standards at all levels (local, state, federal), play an absolutely critical role in safeguarding the food supply of a nation.In this article, we want to focus on the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), a turning point in food safety in the United States that came into being only 12 years ago.IntroductionFSMA, enacted in 2011, is a landmark legislation that revolutionized food safety practices in the United States. Designed to address the challenges posed by an increasingly complex and global food supply chain, the FSMA introduced a comprehensive framework to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure the safety of the nation’s food supply. This article examines the key provisions of the FSMA, its impact on the food industry, and the strides made in safeguarding public health through enhanced preventive measures and regulatory oversight.Overview of the FSMAThe FSMA shifted the focus of food safety in the USA from reactive measures to a proactive, preventive approach. It empowered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the authority to set stringent standards and regulations across the entire food supply chain, from farm to fork. The act encompasses several key components, including preventative controls, inspections, import safety, response to outbreaks, and enhanced partnerships.Preventive controlsOne of the cornerstones of the FSMA is the establishment of preventive controls to identify and address potential hazards before they can cause harm. This includes the implementation of Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) by food facilities. HARPC mandates a systematic approach to evaluate and prevent biological, chemical, and physical hazards in food production, processing, and distribution. It requires food manufacturers to develop and implement comprehensive food safety plans, conduct regular risk assessments, and institute preventive measures.Inspections and complianceThe FSMA introduced a risk-based inspection strategy to ensure compliance with food safety standards. It provided the FDA with increased authority to conduct inspections, sampling, and testing of food facilities. The act also mandated the establishment of a third-party certification program, enabling accredited auditors to assess and certify compliance with the FSMA requirements. Non-compliant facilities can be subject to corrective actions, penalties, and even product recalls if necessary.Import safetyRecognizing the importance of imported foods in the American market, the FSMA strengthened the FDA’s oversight of imported food products. It mandated the development of a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP), which places responsibility on importers to verify that their foreign suppliers meet U.S. safety standards. The act also granted the FDA authority to refuse entry to imported goods from non-compliant facilities and increased the frequency of inspections for high-risk products.Outbreak response and partnershipsIn the event of a foodborne illness outbreak, the FSMA equipped the FDA with enhanced tools to respond swiftly and effectively. It established a food tracing system to track and trace products throughout the supply chain, enabling rapid identification of the source of contamination. Furthermore, the FSMA emphasized collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies, as well as industry stakeholders, to share information and resources and foster a culture of proactive food safety practices.Impact and challengesThe FSMA has had a profound impact on the food industry, leading to improved food safety practices and reduced foodborne illnesses. By shifting the focus towards prevention, the act has encouraged proactive measures, such as better recordkeeping, increased training, and improved sanitation practices. However, implementing the FSMA’s requirements posed challenges for smaller farms and food facilities due to resource constraints and compliance costs. To address these concerns, the FDA has provided educational resources, technical assistance, and flexibility in certain compliance deadlines.ConclusionThe Food Safety Modernization Act has transformed the landscape of food safety in the USA. By prioritizing prevention, enhancing regulatory oversight, and fostering collaboration, the FSMA has made significant strides in safeguarding public health and strengthening consumer confidence in the nation’s food supply.

Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, fungi, yeast",Fermented foods of the world,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/fermented-foods-of-the-world/,"June 3, 2023","Fermented foods offer several potential health benefits due to their unique fermentation process, which involves the action of beneficial bacteria, yeasts, or moulds on the food.  In this first article, part one of three, we want to highlight some of the amazing fermented foods and beverages that have developed, often independently, through the world over the last few hundreds or indeed thousands of years.  In the second part of this three-part series, we’ll delve into the fascinating details of some the fermented vegetable products we list here before covering fermented dairy products in part three.  To start with though, here are some health benefits associated with consuming fermented foods:Improved Digestive Health: Fermented foods contain live beneficial bacteria, often referred to as probiotics, which can help support a healthy gut microbiome. Probiotics aid in digestion, enhance nutrient absorption, and promote a balanced intestinal environment.Enhanced Nutrient Absorption: Fermentation can increase the bioavailability and absorption of certain nutrients present in food. For example, fermentation of soybeans enhances the availability of nutrients like iron and calcium.Strengthened Immune System: The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in immune function, and consuming fermented foods can help support a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Probiotics in fermented foods may stimulate the immune system, potentially reducing the risk of certain infections and allergies.Increased Nutritional Value: Fermentation can enhance the nutritional profile of foods. It can increase the levels of certain vitamins, such as B vitamins, and produce beneficial compounds like antioxidants and short-chain fatty acids, which have been associated with various health benefits.Digestive Enzyme Production: Fermented foods often contain enzymes that aid in digestion. These enzymes can help break down complex carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, potentially easing the burden on the digestive system and promoting better digestion.Reduced Lactose Intolerance Symptoms: Fermentation of dairy products, such as yogurt or kefir, breaks down lactose, the sugar found in milk. This process can make fermented dairy products easier to digest for individuals with lactose intolerance.Potential Weight Management Support: Some research suggests that the consumption of certain fermented foods may be associated with weight management and a reduced risk of obesity. However, more studies are needed to establish a definitive link.It’s important to note that individual responses to fermented foods may vary, and not all fermented foods provide the same health benefits. The specific strains and quantities of beneficial bacteria present in different fermented foods can differ, influencing their potential health effects. Additionally, it’s always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional if you have specific health concerns or conditions.Here are some common (kimchi and sauerkraut) along with unusual and different fermented vegetable and dairy products from around the world:VegetablesKimchi: A traditional Korean dish made from fermented cabbage and other vegetables, such as radishes and scallions, seasoned with chili peppers, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce.Sauerkraut: A fermented cabbage dish originating from Germany and Eastern Europe.

Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, food-quality, yeast",Spoilage of high acid fruit-based beverages,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/spoilage-of-high-acid-fruit-based-beverages/,"April 10, 2023","Introduction to food spoilage bacteria and their role in food deteriorationFood spoilage bacteria are microorganisms that cause undesirable changes in food, resulting in a decline in quality, texture, flavor, and color. These bacteria are ubiquitous, meaning they are present everywhere in the environment. They can enter the food chain through raw materials, processing, handling, and storage. When food spoilage bacteria grow and multiply in food, they produce various enzymes, acids, and other metabolites that lead to spoilage.Understanding the different types of food spoilage bacteriaThere are many types of food spoilage bacteria, but the ones that are most commonly associated with juice spoilage are thermophilic, thermoduric, and spore-forming bacteria.Thermophilic bacteria thrive in high-temperature environments and can survive pasteurisation. They cause spoilage in heat-processed beverages such as juice by producing heat-resistant enzymes that break down the carbohydrates and proteins present in the juice.Thermoduric bacteria can survive pasteurisation but do not grow at high temperatures. They can enter the processing plant through raw materials, equipment, and personnel. They cause spoilage by producing off-flavors and odors in the juice.Spore-forming bacteria are heat-resistant and can survive high-temperature processing. They can form dormant spores that can resist heat, drying, and other adverse conditions. When the conditions become favorable, the spores germinate and grow, causing spoilage in the juice.The impact of food spoilage bacteria on juice productsFood spoilage bacteria can cause various types of spoilage in juice products, such as:Cloudiness caused by bacterial growth and sedimentationOff-flavors and odors caused by the breakdown of organic compoundsGas production caused by bacterial fermentationColor changes caused by the breakdown of pigmentsThese changes can lead to a decline in quality, texture, and flavor of the juice, making it unsuitable for consumption.Factors that influence the growth and development of food spoilage bacteria in juiceSeveral factors can affect the growth and development of food spoilage bacteria in juice products, such as:pH: Most spoilage bacteria prefer a slightly acidic pH range, between 4.5 and 7.0.Water Activity: The availability of water in the juice can affect the growth of spoilage bacteria. The higher the water activity, the more favorable the conditions for bacterial growth.Nutrients: The presence of nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, and vitamins can support bacterial growth.Oxygen: The presence or absence of oxygen can influence the type of bacteria that grow in the juice.Temperature: The temperature at which the juice is stored can affect the growth rate of bacteria.The role of thermophilic and thermoduric bacteria in juice spoilageThermophilic and thermoduric bacteria are the most common types of spoilage bacteria in heat-processed beverages such as juice. They can survive pasteurization and grow at high temperatures, causing spoilage in the juice.Thermophilic bacteria such asBacillus,Geobacillus, andAlicyclobacillusare known for producing heat-resistant enzymes that can break down the carbohydrates and proteins present in the juice. They can cause cloudiness, off-flavors, and odors in the juice.Thermoduric bacteria such asBacillus,PseudomonasandMicrococcuscan survive pasteurisation but do not grow at high temperatures. They can cause off-flavors and odors in the juice, making it unsuitable for consumption.The role of spore-forming bacteria in juice spoilageSpore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus, Clostridium, and Sporolactobacillus are heat-resistant and can survive high-temperature processing. They can form dormant spores that can resist heat, drying, and other adverse conditions. When the conditions become favorable, the spores germinate and grow, causing spoilage in the juice.The impact of heat processing on the growth of spoilage bacteria in juiceHeat processing can kill most bacteria present in the juice. However, it cannot eliminate spores or thermophilic bacteria that can survive pasteurization. The presence of these bacteria in the juice can result in spoilage.A closer look at the most common spoilage bacteria in heat-processed beverages –Bacillus,AlicyclobacillusandGeobacillusBacillus,AlicyclobacillusandGeobacillusare the most common types of spoilage bacteria found in heat-processed beverages such as juice.Bacillus– spore-forming bacteria that can survive high-temperature processing.

Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, yeast",From microbes to meals: Understanding the benefits and challenges of single cell protein for a sustainable future,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/from-microbes-to-meals-understanding-the-benefits-and-challenges-of-single-cell-protein-for-a-sustainable-future/,"April 5, 2023","Single cell protein (SCP) is a term used to describe protein derived from single-celled organisms. SCP is a valuable source of protein for humans and animals alike, and it has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to traditional protein sources like meat and soy. This article will explore the meaning of SCP, the types of SCP, and the benefits and challenges of SCP in the context of a sustainable future.SCP definition and meaningSCP is protein that is derived from single-celled microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and algae. These microorganisms are grown in controlled environments and their protein is harvested for use as food or feed. SCP has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to traditional protein sources like meat and soy because it is produced using fewer resources and has a smaller environmental impact.Types of SCP and their benefitsThere are several types of SCP, each with its own unique benefits. Bacterial SCP is derived from bacteria and is rich in essential amino acids. Fungal SCP is derived from fungi and is high in protein and fibre. Algal SCP is derived from algae and is rich in vitamins and minerals. Each type of SCP has its own unique benefits and can be used in a variety of applications.Understanding cell protein production and single-celled microorganismsSCP is produced through the mass culture of single-celled microorganisms. This process involves growing the microorganisms in large quantities and then harvesting their protein. The microorganisms are typically grown in bioreactors, which are large tanks that are designed to provide optimal growth conditions for the microorganisms. Once the microorganisms have reached maturity, they are harvested and processed to extract their protein.The role of industrial microbiologists in SCP productionIndustrial microbiologists play a critical role in SCP production. These professionals are responsible for designing and optimizing the bioreactors used to grow the microorganisms. They also develop and implement strategies to maximize protein yield and quality. Industrial microbiologists are also responsible for ensuring that the SCP produced is safe for human and animal consumption.Fermentation as a method for SCP mass cultureFermentation is a common method used for SCP mass culture. This process involves the controlled growth of microorganisms in a nutrient-rich environment. The microorganisms are typically grown in bioreactors that are designed to optimize growth conditions. Fermentation is a cost-effective and scalable method for SCP production, making it an attractive option for large-scale production.SCP as a sustainable food sourceSCP is a sustainable food source because it can be produced using fewer resources than traditional protein sources like meat and soy. SCP production requires less land, water, and energy than traditional protein sources, making it a more environmentally friendly option. SCP can also be produced using waste materials like agricultural byproducts, further reducing its environmental impact.Nutritional benefits of SCP foodSCP is a high-quality source of protein that is rich in essential amino acids. It is also low in fat and carbohydrates, making it a healthy option for those looking to reduce their calorie intake. SCP is also a good source of vitamins and minerals, including iron, calcium, and vitamin B12.Challenges and limitations of SCP production and consumptionDespite its many benefits, there are challenges and limitations associated with SCP production and consumption. One of the biggest challenges is the high cost of SCP production, which is currently more expensive than traditional protein sources. SCP also has a strong flavor that can be unappealing to some consumers. There are also concerns about the safety of SCP, particularly in terms of potential contaminants and allergens.SCP in the context of a sustainable futureSCP has the potential to play a significant role in a sustainable future. As the global population continues to grow, the demand for protein will increase, putting a strain on traditional protein sources like meat and soy. SCP offers a sustainable alternative that can be produced using fewer resources and has a smaller environmental impact.Conclusion and future prospects for SCPSCP is a promising protein source that has the potential to play a significant role in a sustainable future. While there are challenges and limitations associated with SCP production and consumption, ongoing research and development are likely to address these issues in the coming years. As demand for protein continues to grow, SCP offers a sustainable alternative that can help to reduce the environmental impact of protein production and consumption.  As consumers, we have the power to drive demand for sustainable protein sources like SCP. By choosing products made with SCP, we can help to reduce our impact on the environment and promote a more sustainable future.","climate change, environmental sustainability, food microbiologist, food microbiology, food science, industrial microbiology, microbiology, protein, scp, single cell protein"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, food-safety, viruses",My favourite books of biochemistry and microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/my-favourite-books-of-biochemistry-and-microbiology/,"March 11, 2023","I love books and the knowledge they contain. These are my absolute favourites in the disciplines I hold nearest and dearest to my heart.  I have been a student of biochemistry and microbiology, lectured in these subject areas and been a researcher too in bacterial physiology, enzymology and protein chemistry.  So really, biochemistry and microbiology are the disciplines at the core of my scientific expertise.To me, the right book just inspires and excites.  Choose the wrong book, and an exciting topic becomes dull and boring.  These books just bring alive the exciting world of biochemistry and microbiology in a logical way through easy-to-read text, appropriate tables and figures and a natural flow of topics.  Some books just don’t do that.If you wish to buy a book in these subject areas, I very highly recommend these titles.  Furthermore, if you follow these links to buy them on Amazon, then I’ll earn a commission, at no extra cost to yourself.  Every so often, I’ll introduce and describe some products that I love and wholeheartedly support.  Then, I’ll move them to a dedicated page on my website here for products I love and how to buy them.  Please support Food Microbiology Academy and buy your books, and other products I recommend, through here!  Many thanks…Bailey and Scott’s Diagnostic MicrobiologyI used this book as a 3rd-year undergraduate student of clinical microbiology at James Cook University (Townsville, Queensland, Australia) in 1997.  While it wasn’t full of fancy colours, at least not then, it was packed with tables and all the absolutely necessary information about microorganisms of clinical significance.Prescott’s MicrobiologyIn 2008, I was the sole lecturer for a 1st-year subject introductory microbiology subject in the biotechnology Bachelor degree course at Box Hill Institute in Melbourne.  When it came time to select the prescribed textbook for my students, there was no doubt in my mind, of course it was going to be Prescott’s Microbiology.Stryer’s BiochemistryWhile I’ve never used it as a student or a lecturer, Stryer has always been my first choice reference source for general and introductory biochemistry.  Comprehensive account of classical biochemistry, this text has stood the test of time for nearly 50 years.  Hard to beat that.Doyle’s Food MicrobiologyOver the years, I have been in awe of the content of Michael Doyle’s amazing book on food microbiology.  A truly tremendous resource that properly covers the field of food microbiology.  If you’re going to compile, then do it properly, and this is one of the very best.Denniston’s General, Organic and BiochemistryAs a lecturer of 1st-year chemistry in 2009 at what is now Melbourne Polytechnic, this was easily my go-to choice of prescribed textbook for my students.  It so eloquently takes the student through the key and fundamental areas of chemistry, and for an introductory text, what I especially like is it’s coverage of biochemistry.","biochemistry, books, food microbiology, microbiology"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"eukaryotic-microbiology, food-quality, fungi, yeast",Fungal contamination of food and how to control it,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/fungal-contamination-of-food-and-how-to-control-it/,"April 26, 2022","This is the final article in our series of fungal spoilage of food products, originally written by Doreen Ting from RMIT University in 2008.  As her project facilitator, I have made some changes to her piece below, but it is largely as per her original submission.Source of Spoilage YeastFood may be susceptible to spoilage with fungal contamination from a variety of sources. This may be from the environment (for example soil, air, and water) or from poor manufacturing process while intrinsic characteristics of the food (such as pH, water activity, and sugar concentration) can increase the likelihood of growth of these fungal contaminants (Ray, 2004; Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). The most commonly food spoiled by yeast, as mentioned earlier are fruits. Fruits, as received at processing plants, are often contaminated with large amounts of yeasts. In some cases, fruits that have been damaged before reaching processing plants, due to poor handling or damaged by birds or insects may contain significantly higher yeast populations (Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). Due to the exposed tissues of these damaged fruits, yeasts are introduced, thus enabling them to use the naturally occurring sugar and nutrients in the fruit to support their growth.Physiological characteristic of the food itself may also encourage the growth of yeast thus leading to spoilage. This may be due to several reasons, which includes: (i) pH value of food; (ii) water activity; and (iii) sugar concentration. Favourable growth conditions for yeast are in foods with low pH values (Martorell et al., 2006; Praphailong & Fleet, 1997;). As mentioned earlier, several species of the yeast genusZygosaccharomyces, were reported growing at a water activity level down to 0.62 (Frazier & Westhoff, 2005; Martorell et al., 2004) and some at a pH value as low as 2.5 (Steels et al., 1999). It is reported that food with a high concentration of sugars are also particularly at risk besides food with low pH (Tilbury 1980, cited in Steels et al. 1999; Thomas & Davenport, 1985; Tournas & Katsoudas; 2005).  As stated by Tournas & Katsoudas (2005), fruits in general contain high concentration of sugar favourable to yeast, which was mentioned earlier (i.e. glucose and fructose), the ideal water activity level with their low pH level thus making them particularly susceptible to spoilage by yeast.Poor manufacturing process may also contribute to spoilage of foods. Processing of food in a non-hygienic environment may lead to contamination of the food and thus leading to spoilage. Food produced in a non-hygienic environment introduces hazards, which can adversely affect the stability of the food product (Vasconcellos, 2004). Introduction of food spoilers at the very start of production increases the risk of food spoilage. Although most spoilers may be killed during processing especially during heat treatment, some yeast strains have the ability to survive in heat-stressed environment (Raso et al., 1998; Tran & Farid, 2004).As stated previously, the low pH of many fruits is the major factor that places them at risk of spoilage by yeast. Despite having most yeasts removed during early stages of processing (i.e. washing and peeling), recontamination can subsequently occur wherever there is opportunity for yeast to growth in later processing stages (Worobo & Splittstoesser, 2005). The use of contaminated equipments for processing (i.e. conveyor belts, slicers, fillers) are potential sources of contamination. Research conducted by Martorell et al. (2007) on yeast strains isolated from a high sugar environment (i.e. candied fruits and nougats) demonstrated resistance to preservatives however, did not show exceptional resistance to biocides such as peracetic acid and hypochlorite. The authors indicated that yeast spoilers might best be prevented through the use of biocidal agents in the factory rather than treating the food with preservatives. Food manufacturers are required to comply with the Codex Alimentarius: Recommended International Code of Practice – General Principles of Food Hygiene (Codex Alimentarius, 2003). In Australia, food manufacturers are required to operate in accordance with the Food Standards Australia New Zealand, which aims to control food safety hazards during production, manufacture, and handling of food (FSANZ, 2008).According to Tapia and Welti-Chanes (2002), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) systems are important tools used by the food industry for production of microbiologically safe food. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) involves general principles of hygiene whereas the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system involves identification of possible hazards and preventative measures necessary for the control of hazards (Vasconcellos, 2004).Control/Prevention MethodsAccording to Loureiro (2000), the consequence of food spoilage is a severe economical loss to the food industry because of the large scale at which food products are made. Due to its detrimental effects to the food industry, food microbiologists have continued to research on various methods in terms of controlling the growth of yeasts. As stated by van der Vossen & Hofstra (1996), it is advantageous to know the identity of the spoilage organism present in the product before designing strategies to prevent spoilage. Amongst the method used for identification and characterisation of spoilage yeast are: (i) analysis of long-chain fatty acids (Loureiro, 2000), and (ii) DNA based identification technology including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Casey & Dobson, 2003; Rawsthorne & Phister, 2006; Renard et al., 2008; van der Vossen & Hofstra, 1996) (iii) monitoring of isoenzymes patterns (Duarte et al., 2004; Loureiro, 2000).As mentioned earlier in the review, several yeast species are able to survive in stressed environments, which include presence of weak-acid preservatives. One species in particular known for its exceptional ability to resist weak-acid preservatives isZygosaccharomyces bailii(Andrews et al., 1997; Steels et al., 1999; Thomas & Davenport, 1985). Inactivation of this particular species was found only in environments with high levels of preservatives (El Halouat et al., 1998). However, due to legal limitations, researchers opted for combination of hurdles to achieve this. Though the mechanism of this has not been thoroughly understood, researchers have continued to carry out experiments on a combination of hurdles in preventing the growth of yeast in food. Weak-acid preservatives used along with pH adjustments (Cole & Keenan, 1986; Nielsen & Arneborg, 2007; Quintas et al., 2004), use of heat with combination of high hydrostatic pressure and pulsed electric field (Raso et al., 1998), and use of different type and amount of carbon source (Levya et al., 1999; Merico et al., 2003) were amongst the methods used in controlling the growth of yeast.Nevertheless, there has been increasing demand for foods with reduced amounts of chemical additives and less physical damage (Palou et al., 1997), in other words minimally processed food. This has lead researchers to investigate the use of modified atmospheric packaging as another alternative in preserving food products from yeast contaminants. Lucas (2003) view modified atmospheric packaging as a technique of shelf-life extension, which involves a mixture of gases including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Restuccia et al., (2006) reported that modified atmospheric packaging in combination with hurdles (i.e. temperature), work synergistically in maintaining freshness, extending shelf life and ensuring the safety of food. El Halouat & Debevere (1996), who conducted a research on the influence of modified atmosphere and preservatives on the growth ofZygosaccharomyces rouxiiisolated from dried fruits, reported on the synergistic effects of inhibiting factors such as low water activity level, preservatives and carbon dioxide. El Halouat et al. (1998) also found that modified atmospheric packaging enhanced the inhibitory effects of weak-acid preservatives used in preventing growth of yeast.Links to prior articles in this series and to the reference list of literature cited in this and/or prior articles.Food spoilage, with special reference to fruit productsBlog article published on 21 April 2022.Significance of yeast in food spoilage and their membrane transport systemsBlog article published on 19 February 2022.Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeastsBlog article published on 13 February 2022.Overall importance and general characteristics of food spoilage yeastBlog article published on 5 January 2020.Food spoilage yeast reference list","food microbiology, food preservation, food science, food spoilage, microbiology, mycology"

I had the privilege of guiding her on the preparation of this substantial piece of work, from which this is extracted from.  In this article, we provide an introduction to bacteria and other types of food spoilage, then delve deeper into spoilage of fruit products.  Such products, due to their origin and intrinsic conditions, tend to be, by and large, spoiled by non-bacterial organisms, almost exclusively fungi, which can be either yeasts and/or moulds.  This article provides some insights into that aspect.Bacterial vs. Non-bacterial SpoilageBacteria are the largest group of microorganism present while yeast is a member of the fungi kingdom.  Besides spoilage caused by yeast, food may also be spoiled by several forms of bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria and spore-forming bacteria (Worobo & Splittstoesser, 2005). Amongst the bacteria listed, lactic acid bacteria and yeast possess similarities in terms of the role they play, both beneficial and detrimental, in the food industry. Lactic acid bacteria and yeast both act as fermentors and both are also associated with spoilage of food. According to Vermeulan et al., (2008), microbial spoilage of acidified sauces stored at ambient temperature are predominantly caused by lactic acid bacteria and yeast. Regardless, both are still very different organisms. Lactic acid bacteria are able to proliferate when exposed to a given substrate that specifically suits their nutritional requriements and under storage conditions with low gas permeability (Farag & Korashy, 2006). Yeast on the other hand, especially the genusZygosaccharomyces, grow and survive in the presence of high concentrations of sugar (Cole & Keenan, 1986; Ludovico et al., 2002; Steels et al., 1999) and under optimum conditions, which includes low pH values (Cole & Keenan, 1986; Vermeulane et al., 2006), and low water activity level (Steels et al., 1999). Nevertheless, Levya et al. (1999) reported that different species ofZygosaccharomycesfavour different types of sugar.Z. bailiiwas found to be fructophilic (Levya et al. 1999; Vermeulan et al., 2008), favouring fructose and therefore metabolising fructose more rapidly compared to glucose. The ability of yeast to thrive in high salt or sugar concentrations environment sets it apart from bacteria. Therefore, they are capable of spoiling certain foods, in which bacteria are not able to grow.Spoilage caused by bacteria may result in organoleptic changes such as souring, slime formation, off-odour, off-flavours, and gas production (Farag & Korashy, 2006). This is most often seen in spoilage of raw meat by lactic acid bacteria. Yeast causes undesirable properties in food by producing off-flavours (Rodrigues et al., 2001), hazing (Rodrigues et al., 2001), emulsion breakage (dressings) (Vermeulan et al., 2008), gas production (Vermeulan et al., 2008), and ethanol production (Vermeulan et al., 2008).ZygosaccharomycesspeciesThe yeast genusZygosaccharomycesis noted for its infamous relationship with food spoilage.  According to Steels et al. (1999), this particular genus includes some of the most osmotolerant organisms known, yeasts which are able to vastly resist concentrations of food preservatives. The osmotolerant species, comprising ofZygosaccharomyces bailii,Zygosaccharomyces rouxiiandZygosaccharomyces bisporusare not only known for their fermentative spoilage in food with high sugar concentration, low water activity, and low pH value but also known for their heat resistance profiles (Chen & Tseng, 1996, Makdesi & Beuchat, 1996). According to Raso et al. (1998),Z. bailiihas the ability to form ascospores, which are more resistant to physical and chemical agents than vegetative cells, thus are also more resistant to heat.Food ProductsFoods are considered habitats for microbial growth. Food products commonly spoiled by yeast range from fresh (raw) fruits to soft drinks. Fruit juices and soft drinks impose an adverse environment for most microorganisms. This is due to their low pH value and low nitrogen and oxygen contents (Deak & Beuchat, 1996). These beverages however have been found to be excellent substrates for growth of yeasts. Fruit juices in particular are found to be most susceptible to yeast spoilage (Keyser et al., 2007; Elez-Martinez et al., 2004; Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). Tran & Farid (2004) stated in their research that yeast is one of the most common spoilers found in fruit juices (i.e. orange juice). Other high sugar foods such as honey, syrups, jams, jelly, and dried fruits are also susceptible to spoilage by yeast (Deak & Beuchat, 1996).Fruit productsAccording to Deak & Beuchat (1996), yeast form a part of the natural microflora of most fruits, which is usually found on the external surface of fruits. Fruits are high in nutrients and moisture content. Its low pH (3 to 5) sets them apart from vegetables in terms of susceptibility to spoilage by yeast.  In addition, fruits are high in soluble carbohydrates, increasing their desirability to yeast as compared to vegetables. Therefore, weak-acid preservatives are widely used in high-sugar, low pH products such as fruit juices in which spoilage are most often caused by yeast. Weak-acid preservatives commonly used in the food industry such as sorbic acid, benzoic acid, propionic acid, acetic acid, and sulphur dioxide (Martorell et al., 2006) has been found to be of little use in preserving food products from spoilage unless a significant level of preservative is added to the food (Martorell et al., 2006). However, a constraint faced in this case is the legal limitation on level of preservative addition.Despite its benefits in reducing risk of obtaining chronic diseases, fruits are still consumed less especially by the younger generation (Ness & Powles, 1997; Steinmetz & Potter, 1996). Studies have shown that not everyone is interested in consuming the recommended dietary intake of fruits (Betts et al., 2003; Padula et al., 2003). Therefore, for many decades, health professionals have collaborated with food manufacturers in developing food products, in hopes of helping people change their dietary habits. This has lead to creation of different food products consisting of fruits, such as fruit juices and fruit yoghurt. However, due to this fast-paced world we currently live in, consumer demands has also moved to a different level. Consumers now demand fruit products, which are convenient and ready-to-eat, however, still containing sufficient nutrients for the recommended dietary intake. Consumer demand has lead to the production of minimally processed fruits. According to Alzamora et al. (2000), minimally processed fruits are products that maintain their attributes and quality similar to those of fresh products, which include dried fruits. The purpose of minimally processed fruits according to Laurila & Ahvenainen (2002) is: (i) to keep produce fresh, without losing its nutritional quality and; (ii) to ensure a product shelf life is sufficient to make distribution feasible within a region of consumption.Dried FruitsDried fruits are one of the most notable minimally processed food products on the market. A high concentration of sugar, low water activity level and low pH value of dried fruits causes it to be one of the food products susceptible to yeast spoilage (El Halouat, 1996). With its high concentration of sugar and its low water activity level, dried fruits are particularly at risk of spoilage by the genusZygosaccharomyces. As sulphur dioxide is most commonly used in preservation of dried fruits (Florin et al., 1993), some species of the genusZygosaccharomyceshave been found to be resistant to this preservative (Martorell et al., 2005; Thomas & Davenport, 1985).Fruits are dried to reduce the water activity level to less than 25% (Worobo & Splittstoesser, 2005), as fruit product usually will not spoil when the water activity level is below 0.65 (Corry 1987, cited in Worobo & Splittstoesser 2005; Pitt & Hocking, 1985).  El Halouat & Debevere (1997) found thatZygosaccharomyces rouxiiwere among the dominant contaminants isolated from high moisture prunes and raisins. High moisture according to Worobo & Splittstoesser (2005) is having a water activity level of at least 35%.Links to prior articles in this series and to the reference list of literature cited in this and/or prior articles.Significance of yeast in food spoilage and their membrane transport systemsBlog article published on 19 February 2022.Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeastsBlog article published on 13 February 2022.Overall importance and general characteristics of food spoilage yeastBlog article published on 5 January 2020.Food spoilage yeast reference list","food microbiology, food preservation, Food quality, food science, food spoilage"
Eukaryotic microbiology,yeast,Significance of yeast in food spoilage and their membrane transport systems.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/significance-of-yeast-in-food-spoilage-and-their-membrane-transport-systems/,"February 19, 2022","This is a (barely edited) extract of a lengthly literature review written by a 3rd-year food science and technology student, Doreen Ting, at RMIT University in 2008 – I (Dr Philip Button) was her project facilitator.  The overall literature review is excellent, and despite its age, at 14 years old now, it will still serve a purpose as a review of the fundamental elements of key food spoilage yeasts.  On 5 January 2020, we published a blog article as part 1 in this series, giving an overview of the significance of yeasts in this context.  On 13 February 2022 we published about the physiology and biochemistry of yeasts in the context of food spoilage.  We won’t label this and subsequent articles as parts, but shall provide links to them, and to a separate document which contains all the literature cited.  In this article, we cover of the overall significance of yeast in a food spoilage context, as well as providing insights into the specific physiological system of membrane transport.  To be successful on numerous fronts, microbial membrane transport systems are key, and here we provide an introduction to these.Significance of yeast in food spoilageYeast are known to be one of the major spoilers in the food industry. Apart from their outstanding role in processes such as leavening of bread and fermentation of wine, yeast has caused vast losses to the food industry. It is able to grow in a wide range of food; high (syrups) to low (beverages) viscosity food, high sugar to high salt content food, and solid food such as fruits.As mentioned earlier, the yeast genusZygosaccharomycesis most notable in the food industry for having three species that poses serious economic spoilage risks to food manufacturers. Some yeast are able to thrive in harsh environments including environments with high levels of preservatives. The three species areZygosaccharomyces bailii,Zygosaccharomyces rouxiiandZygosaccharomyces bisporus. These three species are therefore regarded as osmotolerant (El Halouat & Debevere, 1996).Among the three species,Z. bailiipossess the most distinct and diversified antimicrobial resistance characteristics. A major yeast contaminant spoiling foods and beverages such as mayonnaise, pickles, dried fruits (Verma & Joshi, 2000; Deak & Beuchat, 1996), fruit concentrates (Thomas & Davenport, 1985), soft drinks and wines (Thomas & Davenport, 1985),Z. bailiiis known for its exceptional tolerance to preservatives, high sugar, low acid and pasteurisation regimes (Thomas & Davenport, 1985).Yeast have created undesirable properties in food products including off flavours (Rodrigues et al., 2001), hazing (Rodrigues et al., 2001), emulsion breakage (Encyclopaedia of Food Microbiology 1999, p. 2362), and brown film development on surfaces of food products (Encyclopaedia of Food Microbiology 1999, p. 2362).Z. bailiiis known to metabolise much aggressively compared to the other two species,Z. rouxiiandZ. bisporus. This not only has caused spoilage of food but also has lead to explosion of canned and bottled foods and beverages on the shelf (Levya et al., 1998; Oda et al., 2006). In terms of Occupational Health & Safety, explosion of canned and bottled food products on the shelf are significant as there is a risk of injury (Grinbaum et al. 1994, cited in Steels et al. 1999), which may also cause the company to be exposed to contentious liability issues.Yeast membrane transportThe purpose of yeast membrane transporters can be divided into several aspects: (i) nutrient uptakes (sugar, amino acids, and vitamins) (Belle & Andre, 2001); (ii) importing and exporting of proteins or peptides (Andre, 2004); (iii) exporting of toxic compounds from the cell to prevent any deleterious reaction (Demidchik, Macpherson & Davies, 2004). According to Munn (2000),Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the baker’s yeast, has been widely used as the model organism for the study of many cellular processes, which includes the yeast membrane transport system.The ability of certain yeasts to grow in a low pH environment with the presence of weak-acid preservatives has inflicted heavy losses to the food and beverage industry. Macpherson et al. (2005) believes that understanding the mechanisms of this resistance is the key in developing more effective food and beverage preservation methods. El Halouat & Debevere (1996) stated in their findings that at low pH, an active transport system is induced to remove both hydrogen ions and preservative anions from the cell. Both the hydrogen ions and preservative anions in the product of the dissociation of weak-acid preservatives in the cell (Pampulha & Loureiro-Dias, 1989).Macpherson et al. (2005) conducted a research on the weak-acid preservative resistance of bothSaccharomyces cerevisiaeandZygosaccharomyces bailii. Their research aims to investigate the uptake of potassium cation (K+) by both strains on long-term exposure to benzoic acid. Macpherson et al. (2005) concluded in their findings that long-term exposure to benzoic acid leads to accumulation of potassium cation (K+) by bothSaccharomyces cerevisiaeandZygosaccharomyces bailii, which improved the growth of both strains in the presence of preservative. In the presence of weak-acid preservatives, the plasma membrane H+-ATPase pumps protons out of the cell, which contributes to the inhibition of weak-acid preservatives from toxicating cells.According to Pribylova et al. (2008), K+is required for many physiological functions whereas a high concentration of sodium cation (Na+)is toxic for most cells. A research on the plasma membrane of salt tolerant yeastZygosaccharomyces rouxiihas shown that in order to maintain an optimal cytoplasmic concentration of K+and a stable high intracellular ratio of K+/Na+, the yeast cells possess a transport system, which participate in both detoxication from excess sodium cations and the maintenance of potassium homeostasis and intracellular pH (Pribylova et al., 2008). As mentioned previously, K+assists in the growth of yeast cells by stabilising their intracellular pH despite the presence of weak-acid preservatives. This is also known as the Na+/H+-antiporter system (Pribylova et al., 2008). Watanabe et al. (1999) reported that the Na+/H+-antiporter system ofZygosaccharomyces rouxiihas enabled it to survive in environments with high salt concentration as the system extrudes Na+across the plasma membrane of the cell.Links to related articles and to the reference list of literature cited in this and/or related articles.Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeastsBlog article published on 13 February 2022.Overall importance and general characteristics of food spoilage yeastBlog article published on 5 January 2020.Food spoilage yeast reference list","biology, cell biology, food microbiology, food preservation, Food quality, food science, food spoilage, Fungi, microbiology, mycology"

Eukaryotic microbiology,"probiotics-and-gut-health, yeast",How we address scientific challenges today,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/how-we-address-scientific-challenges-today/,"May 17, 2021","Long gone are the days when microbiologists worked in isolation and produced single-author original research papers, perhaps with the help of a technical assistant or research assistant.  Not only are demands on researchers seemingly greater than they were 100+ years ago, but research today is vastly different from what it was.  Multidisciplinary teams and Interdisciplinary research is the norm, and were not just talking about a team of microbiologists with different interests and different specialties, no I’m talking of teams spanning diverse disciplines in science, and even non-science, sometimes geographically separated by thousands of kilometres and multiple timezones.  Take for example, a project team I was part of at RMIT University several years ago – despite being a food microbiologist, I held a position in the School of Business IT and Logistics, where I worked (in the one project!) with e-commerce and innovative retailing experts, information systems professionals and environmental scientists trained in life cycle analysis (Figure 1).Fig. 1How are we leveraging the diverse expertise across different disciplines’ cross industry and academic 9and private research organisations) and breaking geographical barriers along with cross-cultural differences to advance science, and indeed society.  Really, that is all part of modern day science, and why diverse networking is an essential element of modern research and development pursuits.Another example I want to offer is my postdoctoral work, carried out in the School of Applied Sciences at RMIT University.  While we were all food scientists, I was a food microbiologist working in the Food Chemistry research group on projects in the area of physical chemistry and materials science, with experts in the area of rheology and calorimetric properties of food ingredients.  What might be the connection you may say, between food microbiology and materials science?  In this day and age, almost any discipline has an overlap and influence with another discipline, when talking of applied science and applied research as opposed to basic and fundamental science – which still may diversely multidisciplinary.Let me explain one example of a food scientist working at the interface of microbiology, physical chemistry and materials science.  One’s microbiome is an essential microbial ecosystem unique to the individual that functions in maintaining balance, not only in relation to guy or digestive health, but in other body systems too, even mental health as we are not coming to understand.  As a result of a range of factors, such as antibiotic-based abuse of our microbiome, our body’s microbial ecosystem may get out of balance, resulting in health disruptions, such as the rise and dominance of a pathogenic microorganism, no longer kept in check by ‘friendly’ bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract.  The area of probiotics, gut health and fermented foods is ancient, but enjoying a resurgence in popularity as people seek increasing natural ways to restore and maintain their health.  A traditional approach to restoring the gut bacterial balance is through probiotics consumed in food products, traditionally dairy products.  However, many issues have been raised with survival and the maintenance of viability of probiotic microorganisms in the sometimes harsh conditions found in food products (low pH), manufacturing (high temperature) and gastrointestinal passage (low pH), where sometimes, few viable cells reach the location of the gastrointestinal tract where they need to exert their effects.  While in various situations, basic studies on the microbiology of stress responses have elucidated elements of how tolerance (or lack of) to such conditions occurs, there is still a need for improved viability and survival of the diverse probiotics available, under the widely variable conditions found in products, manufacturing along with storage/distribution.  One approach that has been used in the food industry for delivery of sensitive compounds in found is encapsulation of various types, traditionally microencapsulation, but now encapsulation (Figure 2) on a nano scale – nano encapsulation.  There are many approaches with regard to encapsulation material and how the capsules are prepared that promote improved probiotic survival under different conditions.  Culture preparation is another factor that may be important in the ultimate survival of those encapsulated cells.  For example, in some circumstances, freeze dried cultures can be added to microcapsules, and perform better, with regard to tolerance to extreme environmental conditions, such as those encountered in food, during processing and in gastrointestinal passage.  To ensure that the highest concentration of viable cells possible is applied to the capsule, a cryoprotectant is typically selected that will allow the highest viability following freeze drying.  Certainly, in some cases,  forSachharomyces boulardii, this information is not known and consequently, we are likely to be missing out on maximising the effect of microencapsulation.  Thus, basic studies on cryoprotectants to determine, for example, important physical properties like the glass transition temperature (Figure 3) may be critical in advancement of this area of food science and highlights the cross disciplinary approach that can address a range of real-world problems to advance science.  Therefore, diverse networking and collaboration is essential – why not contact someone new today and expand your professional network?Fig. 2Fig. 3","food microbiology, food science, food scientist, materials science, physical chemistry, probiotics, research"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, food-quality, fungi, yeast",Complexities of shelf-life extension,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/complexities-of-shelf-life-extension/,"January 18, 2021","Food spoilage and the subsequent waste is costly.  The convenience of a long shelf-life benefit all along the supply chain from farm to fork.  Therefore, it is understandable that many start-up food manufacturers undergoing initial, or advanced, prototype development wish to extend the shelf-life of their product, for obvious reasons – today’s post-manufacture supply chains can be long and complex, and expensive too, especially if a cold chain is required.  Thus, achieving a lengthy shelf-life at ambient temperature is many people’s dream!  This also holds true for established food manufacturers, particularly when seeking new, more distant markets (especially in climate locations where temperature control is unreliable) or attempting to become a better proposition for selling in a physical, ‘brick and mortar’ store, where retailers wish to display for as long as possible to avoid price reductions due to food passing its Best Before date, hence cutting into their profit margin.It is not uncommon to look at shelf-life extension or optimisation, largely in terms of the finished product.  What can we do to the food to have it last longer?  Process differently or include preservatives are the two most common thoughts that come to mind when people look at approaches to increase shelf-life, although more brand owners are considering reformulation as a way to lengthen shelf-life.  Ultimately, reformulation should achieve one of two outcomes; I) provide some kind of an antimicrobial substance or II) alter the intrinsic conditions of the food such that the microorganisms cannot grow or grow more slowly.  Natural antimicrobial substances, such as from the inclusion of botanical essential oils (Figure 1) or bacteriocins are examples of such antimicrobial substances that will exert a preservation effect.Figure 1: The four best antibacterial botanic essential oils.If we consider the intrinsic conditions, this is where are really getting back to basics, basic microbial physiology that is learn during introductory microbiology classes … meaning their are factors which govern microbial growth and if these factors cannot be met, the microbes cannot grow, it really is as simple as that.  Examples of such factors are pH and water activity (Figure 2) and in turn, there are various ways to achieve these.  Water activity for example, can be lowered through an increase in salts or sugars.  Really though, the best indicators as to the shelf-life of a food and what is able to spoil it is pH and water activity.  Temperature as an extrinsic factor (Figure 2) can then offer further shelf-life benefits.Figure 2: Some intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors that can influence shelf-life.Water activity is a concept that is sometimes misunderstood, yet plays an absolutely critical role in the shelf-life properties of a product.  So what is water activity?  Is it the same as moisture?  Why is it even important?  Let me delve into these a little – moisture is the water content overall, but within what is considered moisture, there is water bound to food molecules and the like and free water in the food product.  It is this free water, and this free water only, that is available for microbial growth – it is measure on a scale between 0 (minimum) and 1 (maximum) (Figure 3).  Therefore, the concepts of moisture (total water content) and water activity (amount of free water that is able to be used by microorganisms for their growth) are related but different.  While moisture may give an indication of water activity, you cannot be sure, thus it is water activity, which is the definitive measure as to how much water is available in a food product to support growth of microorganisms.Figure 3: Water activity scale.However, if one is really going to optimise shelf-life then a myriad of other factors come into play, right from farm to fork.  While HACCP is the way that food safety risks can be managed and minimised, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) during primary production (Figure 4) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) during manufacture are key elements to ‘squeeze’ every possible amount of shelf-life out of a product.  As a result, shelf-life optimisation needs to be considered in context of the entire agrifood farm to fork supply chain.  There are not a lot of practices that many consider as impactful on shelf-life.  As examples, farm hygiene, manufacturing environment design and airflow are some which might be forgotten as what needs to be considered to optimise one’s product’s shelf-life.  Furthermore, practices of workers is key, as are Standard Operating Practices (SOPs), which may need to be reviewed and updated.Figure 4: Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)Thus, many, many factors come into play when looking extending or optimisation the shelf-life of a food product.  It isn’t as straight-forward as changing processing conditions or adding in some preservatives.  There’s no doubt that it is a complex process requiring painstaking consideration and analysis of primary production, your suppliers, transport, manufacturing environment, personnel, retail conditions and possible temperature and other abuse by consumers during domestic transport and storage.  Therefore, knowing that these factors could be influential isn’t enough to optimise or extend shelf-life, it is vital to know how these factors could come into play in decreasing the shelf-life of your specific product.","food microbiology, food preservation, food spoilage, shelf life"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, yeast",Kombucha is not naturally probiotic.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/kombucha-is-not-naturally-a-probiotic-product/,"November 13, 2020","This topic is in a pretty hot space, because both kombucha and probiotics are very much ‘in fashion’ and trending at the present time across the worldwide, as can be seen in the all-time Google Trends for this word which has showed a slow rise over the last seven years, peaking this year during the third week of January (Figure 1).  Leading the way in search interest on Google for “kombucha” are New Zealand, followed by Australia (Figure 2).  This shows how interest in kombucha is at an all-time high in 2020, especially in New Zealand and Australia, followed by Canada and the United States.  Google interest in “probiotics” has shown an increase ever since records began (Figure 3), with a peak at a similar time earlier this year (late January/early February).  Search interest from Australia (5th) and New Zealand (6th) still ranks highly, although the United States (2nd) and Canada (4th) rank higher, with Singapore at number three.  Perhaps surprising is Trinidad and Tobago at number one – small sample size perhaps?  In any case, kombucha and probiotics are of much interest, particularly from westernised nations of the world with advanced economies.Figure 1: Global Google Trends for “kombucha”.Figure 2: Top five countries searching for “kombucha” on Google Trends.Figure 3: Global Google Trends for “probiotic”.Figure 4: Top five countries for “probiotic” on Google Trends.This strong interest, resurgence is fascinating, given the age-old origins of both kombucha and provides, essentially stretching back millennia for kombucha in particular.  At this stage I want to introduce the distinction between probiotic foods and beverages and fermented foods and beverages.  While there is certainly overlap, in many instances, they are certainly not interchangeable terms.  Let us just consider that all foods/beverages could be categorised as:Fermented and probiotic – for example most yogurts and kimchi.Non-fermented and probiotic – for example some popcorn and some protein bars.Fermented and non-probiotic – for example natural kombucha and sourdough bread.Non-fermented and non-probiotic – for example peanut butter or ice cream.Kombucha is naturally, a fermented and non-probiotic beverage (tea) of ancient Chinese origin with consumption for “magical” properties being known from the Qin dynasty (around 220 BC) with subsequent historical consumption in China, Germany and Russia (Greenwaltet al., 2000).  However even today, despite mass consumption as a functional food for various postulated health benefits, no real evidence of any health benefits exists in the human contextin vivoalthough promising results have been seenin vitroand with animal models (Figure 5) (Moraleset al., 2020).Figure 5: Laboratory testing, animal models and human success to demonstrate health benefits of kombucha. Source: Morales et al. (2020).Kombucha is produced by what is referred to as a SCOBY, aSymbioticCultureOfBacteria andYeasts and is widely known in consumer circles as “tea fungus” (Figure).  Within this symbiotic community (Figures 6 and 7), bacterial diversity is limited to mostly species ofAcetobacterwhile a myriad of yeast species are likely to be present (Teohet al., 2004).  A detailed review by Moraleset al.(2020) has identified the following microorganism groups isolated from kombucha; 22 species of acetic acid bacteria from six genera, 3 species of lactic acid bacteria from two genera and 41 species of yeast from 21 genera –AcetobacterandGluconacetobacterare the bacterial genera with the most species isolated from kombucha whileHanseniasporaandZygosaccharomycesare the yeast genera with the most species isolated.Figure 6: An advanced fermentative state of kombucha (Source: Jayabalanet al., 2014).Figure 7: Microscopic view of SCOBY.  Source: Greenwaltet al.(2000).So, while kombucha is indeed a fermented beverage, it is not fermented with probiotic microorganisms – it is fermented with yeasts and acetic acid bacteria that do not have any demonstrated probiotic benefit.  Therefore, their only role is to turn tea into kombucha through their growth and metabolic activity, thus producing a variety of compounds in the process (Figure 8).  Thus, while you may in fact be consuming live culture in kombucha, these microorganisms that have been used to make kombucha will do little for your gut wellbeing.  From studies conducted on the microbial content of kombucha, there is admittedly some lactic acid bacteria present sometimes, however while they MAY be probiotic, they are most likely present at too low a concentration to confer any health benefit to to the host, which is of course a key element of the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of probiotics.Figure 8: How acetic acid bacteria and yeast ferment tea into kombucha.  Source: Tranet al.(2020).Manufacturers have thus sought to capitalise on the probiotic image of kombucha through the addition of probiotics to the product, that have no role in actually making the product.  This is fine, but it’s worth knowing that such probiotics are an additive because as mentioned above, they do not function in the fermentation process.  Therefore, from this perspective, kombucha has little difference from any other probiotic food or drink to which probiotics are added, to make them probiotic products, of which there are diverse types on the market these days, such as popcorn (Figure 9).Figure 9: A probiotic popcorn product on sale in a Melbourne supermarket. Photo by @pdbuttonLast point, read the science, believe the science and remember to only trust credible sources so as not to be misled by erroneous information that is more easily found online (Figure 10).  While kombucha might be delicious, they are not naturally probiotic and need to be made probiotic through the addition of probiotics (therefore, read the label and see if it is probiotic or a fermented beverage only) and there is certainly no robust evidence that kombucha has any human health benefits, despite such claims below in the popular health media online.Figure 10: An erroneous “blanket” reference to the probiotic and other health properties for all kombucha products.ReferencesGreenwalt, C.

In fact, this video formed the basis of our vlog posted on May 24, which is located here:http://foodmicrobiology.academy/2020/05/24/my-food-microbiology-career/.So anyway, a few days ago my video was found by a (very) young aspiring food microbiologist in Mumbai, India.  This teenage student made some comments to initiate a conversation with my around career advice and guidance, then we continue our discussions through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.  Now, we’re about to formalise our discussions with a mentoring agreement.  This is just great news and of mutual benefit as she can clearly gain from my years on a non-traditional career path and I real feel like I’m ‘giving back’ and encouraging and ‘grooming’ the next generation of passionate food microbiologists to come along and really take on the challenges of the world and solve them, which we can all really achieve together.  This student is pretty amazing because even at her young age, she has a career vision and a firm goal of wanting to work in the area of food safety and foodborne diseases at the World Health Organization.  With such a plan at such an early age, she can so get there as well.  What I wanted this blog post to be was to introduce the career mentoring thatFood Microbiology Academynow offers by elaborating on some of the examples I provided to this mentee during our early discussions.Firstly, too many people, myself included years ago in the mid to late 1990s, have a general career idea but no firm goal and vision.  Without this, you do almost wander aimlessly to some extent.  Thus, I would say – don’t worry about or try and identify what you will study as your undergraduate degree and where until you have identified your dream job.  Then, you can work backwards.  Setting your dream job as your goal will help answer so many questions, such as:Which is the highest degree I’ll need?Do I need to do a Master degree?  if so, should it be a research or coursework Master degree?Which country should I complete my various degrees in?What should my undergraduate degree be in?What sort of opportunities should I seek during holidays or internships to support me reaching my career goal(s)?For example, if you have come to the conclusion that you need a PhD, does the Australian (three years, one laboratory, research only) or North American (four years, laboratory rotations during the first year, 25% coursework) model work better for you and your career.  Then, for training like a PhD, the importance of factors that you should consider can be ranked like this, from most important to least important: Supervisor > Laboratory > Department > University > Country.  Some people get to hung up over doing their PhD in a particular country or a particular university.  However, it is the supervisor that is most critical and I’m sure you can find exceptional academic supervisors leading world-class research groups engaging in cutting edge discoveries located in what many would consider sub-standard universities or lower ranking countries for research training or higher education in general.However, you may not even be at the stage where you can identify your ideal or dream job, but you just have a hankering for food microbiology.  In such case, perhaps consider the following, as a non-exhaustive list of careers in food microbiology that require high levels of responsibility, so senior positions that typical require a PhD:I)Teaching food microbiology in a college/university(professor in a community college).II)Doing food safety research in a university(research-only academic position, like Research Assistant Professor or Senior Research Fellow, in a research-intensive university).III)Teaching food microbiology and doing food safety research in a university(traditional academic position).IV)Doing food safety research and development in a food manufacturing company(only food manufacturing companies of substantial size, like Nestlé would engage in such R&D)V)Consulting and therefore providing advice to small and medium size food companies on keeping their products safe(either as an independent consultant or working for a scientific consulting firm).VI)Managing food safety at a large food manufacturing company(this may be part of a quality management role of if the food manufacturing operation is large enough, then it would be a seperate position).VII)Tracking foodborne diseases and identifying sources of outbreaks(such as at a government health organisation, which could be at a national level like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States or the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory in the Australian state of Victoria)VIII)Developing public health strategies and government policy to reduce foodborne disease(an advisory role in government to assemble scientific information and make recommendations for policy and legislative changes to protect the health of the citizens under the jurisdiction of the government you’re working for).So, if you’re a budding food microbiologist (no pun intended!) or simply want to find out more about careers and working in our field, do contact myself (Dr Philip Button, @pdbutton, by e-mail to philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academy).","career, career choice, food microbiologist, mentoring"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"food-quality, food-safety, fungi",Spoiled retail chicken.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/spoiled-retail-chicken/,"May 27, 2020","Woolworths responds after shopper’s ‘absolutely disgusting’ find in chicken — 7NEWS.com.auAs a food microbiologist specialising in food safety, food spoilage, food quality and food preservation, this recent news report (link above) from earlier this month was of particular interest to me.  First of all, I want to provide a response to four particular parts of that news story, then give a general commentary from my perspective.Posting photos appearing to show the mould spots to Facebook, James says he was lucky to spot the problem with the chicken – which was still well within the “best before” period – before eating it.Initially when I saw this reference to a “Best Before” date, I assumed the consumer had got expiry dates mixed up and he actually meant “Use By”, because I understand there is still a great degree of confusion amongst consumers regarding expiry dates on food.  So, in any case, this news story has a photo of the chicken packet and indeed, the expiry date is “Best Before”.  This leads me to ask, why is it a “Best Before” date and not a “Use By” date?  There are major differences between these two expiry dates with “Best Before” dates referring to product quality as impacted by food spoilage while “Use By” dates refer to product safety (Figure 1).  A product has its best quality guaranteed up to the “Best Before” date, after which date it is still safe to consume, but there may be some quality deviation from what consumers expect.  For example in colour or texture.  However,  “Use By’ dates refer to food safety considerations.  After the “Use By” date, food should not be consumed as its safety is not guaranteed.  Chicken is one of the foods, maybe the number food, that has the highest contamination potential from a food safety perspective.  Campylobacter and Salmonella are often seen in the top two microorganisms responsible for foodborne disease, in many countries … and which food(s) are typically vehicles of transmission?  Poultry and poultry products.  Thus, chicken is very much a potential food safety hazard, and it should have a “Use By” date rather than a “Best Before date”.Figure 1: The difference between Use By and Best Before.2.“The mould has been growing for at least a couple of days and it still had two days until the expiry date!I’m sorry, but is this guy a mycologist or a general microbiologist?  How does he know it had been growing for “at least a couple of days” when the product was stored at refrigeration temperature?  I can tell you, if mould spores germinated at refrigeration temperature, you certainly would not see any visible (not to the naked human eye anyway!) growth.  After two days, growth would still be microscopic.  It just amuses me when someone from the general public, who doesn’t know bacteria from mould and thinks you can get sick from growth of food spoilage microorganisms, makes comments like this.3. “Maybe the product was not handled or stored properly (not refrigerated correctly either during transport or once arriving to the store maybe?) which caused the bacteria/mould to grow, which again means the product should not have been sold.This is what I mean where he doesn’t know whether he has seen bacterial growth or mould growth.  Then, trying to identify where in the supply chain the cold chain was broken.  Just stick to the facts and not dramatise it all and don’t try to point fingers when you don’t know where to point them.4.“If myself and my family had eaten this we could have gotten very sick, and that is not good enough. We expect better.”…and here, I leave the best one until last!  He thinks they could have become sick from consuming some (minor) spoiled food.  If it is common for the general public to think that they can become sick from eating spoiled food, then we have a big issue on our hands of trying to bust some pretty big myths.  For the record, let it be known that spoiled food is generally speaking, safe to eat – I have no problem with eating a small amount of mouldy food for example.  While it might be safe to eat, the main issue will be based on quality, as the food may be unpalatable.  Just think, if foodborne disease was caused by spoiled food, then foodborne disease would rarely occur, right?  However it doesn’t.  Foodborne disease is caused pathogenic microorganisms that have grown in or on a food without causing detectable changes to the food.  This is why and how it is so easy to come down with a foodborne disease, because we just don’t know when we might consume an infectious dose of pathogenic microorganisms!Overall, I think this has just highlighted the degree of scientific literacy in Australian society.  Clearly, as food science professionals, we have some work to do in the area of public awareness.  One undervalued area in food science and technology is its crossover with supply chain management and logistics.  Many people I feel, just cannot appreciate the complexities of modern agrifood supply chains (Figure 2).  People at each and every step of the often long and involved agrifood supply chain for a given product are doing there best, and unfortunately, once in a blue moon, a mishap occurs.  Now, that is no reason to ‘crucify’ someone over this.  This is especially so when one consider the impeccable food safety and food spoilage record of primary producers, logistics and retailers and that spoilage of food and safety breaches are more likely to occur in the domestic environment, yes, carelessness in our homes is more likely to result in spoiled food, wasted food and foodborne disease due to cross-contamination and temperature control.Figure 2: An example agrifood supply chain.","chicken, consumers, food microbiology, food spoilage, retail"

Therefore, there’s no doubt that microbiologists are particularly valuable at the moment.  Especially virologists and those microbiologists that have an understanding of infectious diseases, public health and/or epidemiology.  Plus, some knowledge of immunology can be helpful to for vaccine development as can pharmacology for drug development.  However, it’s really the microbiologists that are coming to the fore.  People talk about ‘saving the world’ and about the impact and importance of careers, but microbiologists really can save the world.  If you had any doubt about the importance of a career in microbiology, then just consider what is happening in the world now and what has happened since December.  …and we’re not just talking about personal and public health, but livelihoods and the global economy.  The economy has gone ‘pear-shaped’ because of a microbiological phenomenon, something that could be stopped by microbiologists, if they are, or were given the opportunity.  The power is in the hands of microbiologists and those with an intricate understanding of microbiology, to save the world, I have no doubt about that.  So, if you want a powerful career, an impactful career, a highly significant career, then consider microbiology!A FOOD MICROBIOLOGY CAREERHow about a career in food microbiology?  What might that look like and what might one be involved with?  Well even in food microbiology there are many varied areas to work in.  The three key areas are: i) food safety, ii) food spoilage/food quality and iii) fermented foods, probiotics and gut health.  Each of these has highly significant impacts on society and on the economy.  Let’s look at each of these in more detail.What is food safety?Food safety is all about ensuring the safety of the food supply.  This means monitoring, auditing, regulating and developing policy for the purposes of safeguarding raw materials and manufactured food over the entire agrifood supply chain from ‘farm to fork’ or ‘paddock to plate’ as the concept goes.  Food safety microbiologists closely associate with epidemiologists, public health professionals and infectious disease experts to combat prevention, tracking and limiting the spread of foodborne diseases of epidemic proportions.What is food spoilage and food quality?Spoilage and subsequent wastage of food results in substantial economic losses.  In countries with developing economies, such spoilage and waste of food is more likely to be fresh produce and thus postharvest and pre-manufacure losses.  In countries with advanced economies, the situation is quite different, with substantial spoilage and waste taking place at the consumer level.  Tight supply chains along with excellent mechanisms of food preservation mean that spoilage losses in such countries are at a minimum.What are fermented foods, probiotics and gut health?This area is closely linked with personal health and wellness.  There is a sustained food trend in the area of probiotics as functional foods, along with prebiotics and people realise the great benefits of how one’s gut health contributes to overall health and wellbeing.  Related to this are fermented foods, many of which are probiotic, and as such, are rich natural sources of ‘good’ bacteria.CAREER PROFILE OF A FOOD MICROBIOLOGISTWondering how a career in food microbiology might actually look like in reality?  Well, I had a Q & A session with Lucy Lam, a food safety auditor from Taipei, Taiwan.  Let’s find out what Lucy’s food microbiology career looks like…What qualification(s) do you hold and from where?Master of Science, with a major in food, nutrition and technology, from The Chinese University of Hong KongBachelor of Food Science, from The University of MelbourneYour present position and where?Auditor, Bureau Veritas Certification  (Taiwan)How would you describe your career ‘in a nutshell’?A passion for food safety and quality control along with being good at problem solving. 1.

We’ve teamed up to share our understanding of the food product development process to assist accomplished home cooks, home cooks that have an idea that they may want to pursue commercialisation of a much-loved home cooked dish.  Dr Timilsena has contributed the section on the practice of food product development, whereas I have written on the principles of food product development.Figure 1: The front cover of my forthcoming book.For an insight into our soon to be released forthcoming joint publication, I’ve provided the below text below, which is an extract from the book.

It’s of biological origin and is produced in the agricultural environment. Therefore, the presence of microorganisms on and sometimes in the raw material, along with the finished food product, is unavoidable.  Of course there are many instances of product contamination that are avoidable.  Biofilms on processing equipment, non-aseptic filling and poor hygiene practices of food processing line workers are instances of avoidable contamination. When one considers potential for microbial contamination, there are vast differences between commodities, with each type of raw material and finished product having its own characteristic microflora and spoilage, as well as safety considerations. This reflects the natural flora of the primary production environment and of the prevailing conditions within the food, the conditions which can dictate growth and hence the type of microorganisms that grow there. Shelf-life, what limits it and how best to extend it, is a complex process in which many factors come into play. Each factor needs to be considered individually, then in concert with one another, and not just at a single point in time, but how these factors play out along the usually complex agrifood supply chain with the dynamic microbial communities present.It’s important to reach a stage of relative satisfaction with regard to a so-called ‘base’ formulation for your product. A formulation that one could make subtle changes to or tweak, in response to what shelf-life investigations might reveal. With the intended supply chain in mind, and the base formulation in place, shelf-life trials can commence. Of course, the best way to approach this is to simulate shelf-life, and indeed this is the most obvious, simplest and the one which would yield the most precise results. However, in the case of long shelf-life products, and we’re talking about products with a shelf-life as long as one or two years here, the conduct of a shelf-life trial for two years may be impractical. Under such circumstances, accelerated shelf-life trials or predictive modelling can be undertaken, and there are various research papers in the scientific literature describing mathematical modelling of the growth of various microorganisms from a spoilage or safety consideration.To know where to start extending shelf-life, it is important to know some basic facts – such as the current shelf-life, the preservation approaches currently employed, what limits shelf-life, length of the current and anticipated supply chain and the expected environmental conditions experienced, along with the microbiological quality of the raw materials and the processing environment. This information, coupled with an understanding of the typical spoilage or pathogenic microorganisms associated with that food, will give an excellent indication as to how shelf-life can be extended. There are many ways to extend shelf-life – chemical preservatives, traditional processes such as heat and a myriad of new and emerging non-thermal methods of food preservation, among others. Some are better suited to certain food types, certain microorganisms or may have other constraints related to the supply chain or economic considerations.","food microbiology, food product development, food science, food spoilage, product development"
Eukaryotic microbiology,"eukaryotic-microbiology, food-quality, fungi, yeast","Yeasts and food spoilage: Part 1, Overall importance and general characteristics.",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/yeasts-and-food-spoilage-part-1-overall-importance-and-general-characteristics/,"January 5, 2020","By: Doreen Ting and Philip ButtonOriginally written by Ms Doreen Ting in 2008, with guidance from Dr Philip Button.  Current update and partial rewrite by Dr Philip Button.Food serves as a source of nutrition for humans and animals. However, it also serves as a substrate for the growth of microorganisms. The growth of microorganisms can be beneficial (for example, during production of fermented foods) as well as non-beneficial (growth in food leading to spoilage). Yeast (unicellular fungi) are undoubtedly the most important group of microorganisms exploited for commercial purposes, in particular bread making and the production of alcoholic beverages (Deak & Beuchat, 1996). To give an indication of the economic importance of wine to the Australian, data from Wine Australia (2019) show 63% of Australian wine is exported to a total value of $2.8 billion.  However, yeast has also been a major concern in the food industry in terms of their ability to alter the quality of food products, hence impacting shelf life. The undesirable growth of yeast in some food products causes significant economic losses to the food industry. Deak & Beuchat (1996) state that yeast in general, are capable of growing in a wide range of foods under very specific environmental conditions, and under such conditions, metabolic activities of yeast may result in extensive economic losses to the food industry.  Such conditions include 65-70% (w/w) sucrose, where the extremely low water activity results in very limited competition (Tokuoka, 1993).  Spoilage of food products by yeast is detectable through odour or taste, in addition to physical changes. Therefore, in hopes of finding the best control method for these spoilage yeasts, one approach is adopting a “hurdle technology” concept such as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, which will be detailed in a subsequent part in this series.Yeast are certainly of special interest to food microbiologists due to the significant economical losses they cause to the food and beverage industry.  This is especially so because they are able to grow in a wide range of food; high (syrups) to low (beverages) viscosity food, high sugar to high salt content food, and solid food such as fruits.  These yeasts are characterised by their ability to not only survive, but thrive in environments hostile to many other microorganisms (Makdesi & Beuchat, 1996).  While osmotolerance is generally recognised across this genus (El Halouat  & Debevere, 1996), Malfeito-Ferreira (2019) says thatZ. rouxiiis recognised for its high-level osmotolerance whileZ. bailiihas a reputation for resistance to multiple normally lethal conditions, such as low pH, high organic acid concentration, preservatives and it also possess high osmotolerance.  Its ability to tolerate stress conditions is of major concern to the food industry, and in fact Malfeito-Ferreira (2019) states that members of theZygosaccharomycesgenus are amongst the most “feared” spoilage organisms amongst manufacturers of high sugar and high acid products.Z. bailii(Figure 1) in particular, is recognised as “the most preservative-resistant organism known” (Stratford & Capell, 2003).  Not only that, but stress cross protection has been observed in this species where exposure to a given preservative confers resistance to other preservative agents (Stratfordet al., 2013).  Furthermore, the fructose fermentation preference (typically producing acid and gas) ofZ.bailiiis a less common characteristic that can be exploited in its isolation from spoiled foods (Smittle & Flowers, 1982). These are major yeast contaminants, spoiling foods and beverages such as pickles, dried fruits (Verma & Joshi, 2000; Deak & Beuchat, 1996), mayonnaise (Kurtzmanet al., 1971), fruit concentrates (Thomas & Davenport, 1985), soft drinks (Thomas & Davenport, 1985) and red wine (Malfeito-Ferreira, 2019).Figure 1:Zygosaccharomyces bailiiImage source: M. Stratford, C.J. Capell, inEncyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition (Second Edition), 2003Yeast have created undesirable properties in food products including off flavours and haze (Rodrigues et al., 2001) along with excessive carbon dioxide production (Zuehlke, 2003).Z. bailiiis known to metabolise much aggressively compared to the other two species,Z. rouxiiandZ. bisporus. This not only has caused spoilage of food but also has lead to explosion of canned and bottled foods and beverages on the shelf (Levya et al., 1999; Oda et al., 2006).ReferencesDeak, T & Beuchat, LR (1996).

Fermented foods,"fermented-foods, immunity, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",The Role of Fermented Foods in Enhancing Immunity: Insights from Recent Studies,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-role-of-fermented-foods-in-enhancing-immunity-insights-from-recent-studies/,"May 9, 2024","By: Zixian Zhao – Cancer immunologistat Food Microbiology AcademyIn the realm of nutritional science, the connection between diet and immune health has been extensively explored, revealing complex interactions that influence overall health. Recent studies have particularly highlighted the role of fermented foods in modulating the immune system, offering promising avenues for enhancing immune responses and managing various health conditions. This blog article delves into the findings from recent research to unpack how fermented foods can be pivotal in boosting immunity.Understanding Immunity and NutritionOur immune system, a sophisticated network of cells and proteins, serves as the body’s defence against infections. The critical role of nutrition in supporting immune function is well-documented, highlighting that proper nutrients are essential for robust immune health and disease prevention. Unlike simple probiotic supplements, fermented foods sometimes contain live cultures that can function as probiotics,  often bacteria and sometimes yeasts that are integral to gut health—a major player in immunological well-being.  Furthermore, the fermentation process results in a myriad of metabolic compounds, many of which are of much benefit to human health.Key Findings from Recent ResearchNutritional Control of Immunity: The interaction between diet and immune cell functionality is intricate. According to Veronica De Rosa and her team, dietary components profoundly influence the equilibrium between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes, thus impacting health outcomes significantly (De Rosa et al., 2015).Nutritional Immunology: Fleur Ponton and colleagues discuss the multifaceted relationship between malnutrition—both under-nutrition and over-nutrition—and immune impairment, which heightens disease vulnerability (Ponton et al., 2011).Fermented Foods and Immune Modulation: Upasana Sarma and Suchandra Gupta’s research on Indian ethnic fermented foods illustrates how microbial activity in these foods not only fills nutritional voids but also enhances immunity across various populations (Sarma & Gupta, 2022).Clinical Implications for Cancer Patients: In a pivotal study, Nan Lin et al. found that fermented vegetables could alleviate adverse effects in esophageal cancer patients undergoing combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy, by bolstering nutritional and immunological parameters (Lin et al., 2022).Fermented Foods in Experimental Models: Investigations into Xeniji, a fermented food product, have demonstrated its potential to bolster antioxidant levels and immune responses in mice, highlighting the health-supportive properties of fermented foods (Zulkawi et al., 2017), at least in a mouse model.The Science Behind Fermented Foods and ImmunityFermented foods enhance immunity primarily through their impact on gut health. The fermentation process increases the bioavailability of nutrients, which can better support immune functions. Additionally, the microorganisms that are sometimes present in fermented foods help balance the gut microbiome, a critical element for a healthy immune system. By improving gut health, fermented foods indirectly enhance immune responses and reduce inflammation.Practical ApplicationsIncorporating fermented foods into the diet can be a strategic approach to improve immune health. Examples include:Yogurt and Kefir: Rich in lactobacilli, these foods can enhance gut flora and immune function.Kimchi and Sauerkraut: These fermented vegetables are high in vitamins that can help boost the immune system.Expanding on Fermented Foods and Immune HealthGlobally, fermented foods are integral to many traditional diets and are prized for their distinct flavours and health-promoting properties, especially in enhancing immune health. These foods boost immunity largely by improving gut health. The fermentation process enriches the availability of nutrients, thereby supporting the immune system more effectively. Although fermentation does not generate probiotics, it cultivates conditions that encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria, including probiotics, provided they are part of the initial ingredients. By promoting a balanced gut microbiome, fermented foods indirectly bolster immune function and mitigate inflammation.Future Research Directions in Fermented Foods and ImmunityFuture research on fermented foods and immune health should focus on identifying specific probiotic strains with the highest therapeutic potential, understanding the mechanisms through which these foods influence immune cells via the gut microbiota, and assessing the long-term health impacts of their regular consumption. Studies could also explore the role of fermented foods in managing non-communicable diseases through immune modulation and develop personalised nutrition strategies based on individual microbiome differences. This targeted research could lead to more precise dietary recommendations and innovative health solutions.ConclusionThe intersection of nutrition and immune health is a critical area of study, particularly in the context of increasing health issues related to poor dietary choices. Fermented foods, especially those with a rich probiotic content have health-enhancing properties, and offer a valuable tool for improving immune health. As research continues to unfold, it becomes clear that integrating fermented foods into daily dietary practices can be a beneficial strategy for maintaining health and preventing disease.In conclusion, while more clinical trials and research are needed to fully understand the optimal types and quantities of fermented foods for health benefits, the current evidence strongly supports their role in promoting a healthy immune system and overall health. Incorporating these foods into a balanced diet, alongside other healthful practices, could potentially lead to better health outcomes and a stronger immune systemReferencesDe Rosa, V., Galgani, M., Santopaolo, M., Colamatteo, A., Laccetti, R., & Matarese, G.

Their role extends beyond mere digestion aid, intertwining with the intricate workings of the immune system. This blog post delves into the multifaceted influence of probiotics on gut health and immunity, uncovering the science behind their beneficial effects.Probiotics explainedProbiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. These beneficial bacteria and yeasts are predominantly found in fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and kombucha, or as dietary supplements. They are known to enhance gut flora, or the microbiome, which is a complex community of microorganisms living in our intestines...The gut microbiome: A central player in healthThe gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the body’s overall health, affecting everything from digestion and nutrient absorption to immune function and even mental health. A balanced gut microbiome helps to break down food, synthesise vitamins, and protect against pathogens. Probiotics contribute to this balance, adding to the diversity and functionality of the gut’s microbial community.Probiotics and gut healthThe relationship between probiotics and gut health is symbiotic. Probiotics aid in maintaining a healthy intestinal environment by:Enhancing the intestinal barrier: They strengthen the gut lining, preventing harmful substances and pathogens from leaking into the body.Balancing the microbiome: Probiotics help restore and maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, especially after disruptions caused by antibiotics, poor diet, or illness.Supporting digestion and nutrient absorption: They assist in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients, which is crucial for overall health.Immunity boost through gut healthA significant portion of the immune system resides in the gut, making gut health and immunity deeply interconnected. Probiotics influence the immune system by:Regulating immune responses: Probiotics can modulate the immune system, enhancing its ability to fight off infections while also preventing excessive inflammation, often associated with autoimmune diseases.Producing antimicrobial substances: Some probiotics produce substances that have antimicrobial properties, which can directly combat pathogenic bacteria.Enhancing mucosal immunity: Probiotics stimulate the activity of mucosal immune cells, boosting the body’s first line of defense against pathogens.Probiotics in disease prevention and managementResearch suggests that probiotics can play a role in preventing and managing various health conditions, particularly those related to gut health and immune function, such as:Gastrointestinal disorders: Probiotics are beneficial in managing conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and infectious diarrhea.Immune-related conditions: Regular intake of probiotics has been linked to reduced severity and frequency of respiratory infections, allergies, and certain autoimmune disorders.Mental health: Emerging evidence supports the role of probiotics in improving mood and cognitive function, shedding light on the gut-brain axis.Choosing the right probioticsThe probiotic world is diverse, with different strains offering specific health benefits. The efficacy of probiotics depends on the strain, dosage, and individual health conditions. For example,Lactobacillus rhamnosusGG andSaccharomyces boulardiihave been extensively studied for their positive effects on gastrointestinal health..Incorporating probiotics into the dietTo reap the benefits of probiotics, incorporating them into the daily diet is key. Fermented foods naturally rich in probiotics and high-quality supplements can be excellent sources.

Fermented foods,"fermented-foods, food-quality, probiotics-and-gut-health",A journey through the history of food microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/a-journey-through-the-history-of-food-microbiology/,"October 24, 2023","The world of food is not merely a feast for the senses; it is a realm teeming with invisible life. The study of food microbiology, a fascinating and indispensable branch of science, has revealed the hidden microcosm that plays a pivotal role in the production, preservation, and safety of the food we consume. As we delve into the annals of history, we’ll unearth the remarkable journey of food microbiology, from its nascent beginnings to its crucial role in contemporary food science and safety.The dawn of microbiologyThe story of food microbiology commences in the early 17th century when the Dutch merchant and amateur scientist, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, crafted simple microscopes and laid the groundwork for microbiology as a whole. Using these rudimentary devices, Leeuwenhoek examined various biological samples, including water and tiny flecks of food. In 1676, he became the first person to witness bacteria through a microscope, marking the dawn of microbiology.Spontaneous generation and fermentationIn the centuries that followed, the relationship between microorganisms and food remained largely uncharted territory. The prevailing belief was in spontaneous generation, the idea that life could arise spontaneously from non-living matter. For example, it was widely believed that food spoilage was a result of spontaneous generation rather than the activity of microorganisms.It was not until the 18th century that scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani conducted groundbreaking experiments to refute the theory of spontaneous generation. His meticulous work with food preservation, particularly the sealing of broth in sterile containers, demonstrated that food spoilage could be prevented by preventing the entry of microorganisms.Another pivotal figure in the history of food microbiology is Louis Pasteur, who conducted extensive research on the fermentation processes used in food and beverage production. In the mid-19th century, Pasteur demonstrated that microorganisms were responsible for fermentation in products like wine, beer, and bread. His work laid the foundation for the controlled fermentation processes we use in the food industry today.The birth of modern food microbiologyThe late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a surge in scientific understanding of food microbiology. This period witnessed the identification of specific microorganisms responsible for foodborne illnesses and the development of technologies to combat foodborne pathogens.One pivotal discovery came in the late 19th century when Robert Koch, a pioneering figure in medical microbiology, isolated the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis. This marked a significant step in the identification of pathogenic microorganisms in food. Soon after, scientists identified bacteria such asSalmonellaandEscherichia coli(E. coli) as the culprits behind foodborne illnesses, leading to the development of the first food safety regulations and guidelines.The advent of food preservation methodsWith the understanding of microorganisms’ role in food spoilage and foodborne illnesses, researchers began to develop food preservation methods that harnessed this knowledge. One such method, pasteurisation, was named after Louis Pasteur. It involved heating food products to specific temperatures for a set duration to kill harmful microorganisms while preserving the food’s quality. Pasteurization remains a crucial food processing method, used for dairy products, juices, and various beverages.The 19th century also saw the development of canning, a method that involved sealing food in airtight containers to prevent microbial contamination. This method, pioneered by Nicolas Appert and later perfected by Louis Pasteur, revolutionized food preservation and contributed to the global expansion of food industries.The era of microbiological standards and regulationsAs the food industry grew, so did concerns about food safety. The need for standardized procedures and regulations to ensure the microbiological safety of food became apparent. In the early 20th century, the United States established the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, marking one of the earliest efforts to regulate food safety. This act laid the foundation for the creation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1930.Around the same time, microbiological standards were developed, setting limits on the permissible levels of certain microorganisms in food products. These standards helped ensure the safety of food by regulating the number of harmful microorganisms allowed in products.The discovery of antibiotics and food microbiologyThe discovery of antibiotics in the mid-20th century had a significant impact on food microbiology. Antibiotics like penicillin and tetracycline were not only used to treat human infections but also found applications in agriculture and food production. They were used to control bacterial contaminants and diseases in livestock, contributing to increased food safety.However, the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture has raised concerns about antibiotic resistance in foodborne pathogens. This issue continues to be a subject of study and regulatory efforts in contemporary food microbiology.Modern food microbiologyThe late 20th century and early 21st century have witnessed a proliferation of advanced techniques and tools in food microbiology. Molecular biology, genomics, and bioinformatics have provided scientists with unprecedented insights into the microbial communities present in food and their impact on safety and quality.Techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing have enabled the rapid and accurate detection and identification of microorganisms in food. This has been invaluable for tracking outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, investigating contamination sources, and ensuring the safety of food products.The field of food microbiology has also expanded its scope to include the study of probiotics, prebiotics, and the human microbiome. Probiotics are beneficial microorganisms that can improve gut health and overall well-being when consumed in certain food products. Prebiotics, on the other hand, are non-digestible compounds that support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.Challenges and future directionsAs our understanding of food microbiology continues to grow, so do the challenges we face. The globalization of food production and distribution has made it increasingly difficult to monitor and control foodborne pathogens. Emerging pathogens and antimicrobial resistance are ongoing concerns that require constant vigilance and research.Additionally, the demand for more sustainable and environmentally friendly food production practices is driving innovation in food microbiology. The development of alternative protein sources, such as plant-based and cell-cultured meats, presents new challenges and opportunities in terms of microbial safety and quality control.ConclusionThe history of food microbiology is a testament to the ever-evolving relationship between science and our culinary world. From the humble observations of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek to the advanced molecular techniques of today, food microbiology has uncovered the invisible forces that shape the safety and quality of our food.As we move forward, the challenges of a globalised food supply chain, emerging pathogens, and the quest for sustainable food production will continue to shape the field. With the lessons of the past as our guide, food microbiology will play a critical role in ensuring that our meals are not only delicious but also safe and sustainable for generations to come.","food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology, probiotics"

Fermented foods,"bacteria, fermented-foods",Kimchi and sauerkraut: Ancient power foods for strong health and wellbeing,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/kimchi-and-sauerkraut-ancient-power-foods-for-strong-health-and-wellbeing/,"May 29, 2023","Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish that has been a staple of Korean cuisine for thousands of years. The origins of kimchi can be traced back to ancient Korea, where it was developed as a way to preserve vegetables during the winter months when fresh produce was scarce.Early forms of kimchi were made by fermenting vegetables like radishes and cucumbers with salt and spices. Over time, the recipe for kimchi evolved to include a variety of vegetables, including cabbage, and the use of chili peppers became more widespread.Kimchi has played an important role in Korean culture and cuisine throughout history. It has been a staple food in Korean households for generations and is often served at special occasions and celebrations.During the Korean War in the 1950s, kimchi became an important symbol of Korean identity and cultural heritage. The government even established a Kimchi Research Institute to promote the production and consumption of kimchi.Today, kimchi is enjoyed not only in Korea but also around the world. Its popularity has led to the development of many different varieties, with different ingredients and levels of spiciness. Kimchi is also known for its many health benefits, including being a good source of vitamins, fiber, and beneficial bacteria that promote gut health.Kimchi is a fermented vegetable dish that is widely consumed in Korean cuisine. It is made by combining cabbage, radishes, scallions, and other vegetables with a spicy and savory seasoning paste, then allowing the mixture to ferment over time. Kimchi is not only delicious but also has several potential health benefits:Probiotic properties: Kimchi is a rich source of beneficial bacteria known as probiotics. These bacteria are known to support digestive health, boost immunity, and may even have a positive impact on mental health.Antioxidants: Kimchi is rich in antioxidants, which help protect the body from damage caused by harmful molecules known as free radicals. Antioxidants are associated with several health benefits, including reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.Low calorie and high fiber: Kimchi is low in calories but high in fiber, which can help promote feelings of fullness and support healthy digestion.May reduce inflammation: Some studies have suggested that kimchi may help reduce inflammation in the body, which is linked to several chronic diseases. This is due in part to the presence of compounds such as capsaicin, which is found in chili peppers and has been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects.May boost brain function: Some studies have suggested that the probiotics found in kimchi may have a positive impact on brain function, including improving memory and reducing anxiety and depression symptoms.It is important to note that more research is needed to fully understand the health benefits of kimchi, and that some store-bought varieties may be high in sodium and preservatives. Homemade kimchi, or varieties that are low in sodium and preservatives, may offer the most health benefits.Sauerkraut is a type of fermented cabbage that has been consumed for centuries in various forms across Europe. The origins of sauerkraut can be traced back to ancient China, where fermented cabbage was used as a staple food and medicinal remedy.The practice of fermenting cabbage eventually spread to Europe, where it became a popular food among Germanic and Eastern European cultures. Sauerkraut was particularly popular in Germany, where it became a staple food during the winter months when fresh vegetables were scarce.In the 18th century, the British Royal Navy began using sauerkraut as a source of Vitamin C to prevent scurvy among sailors on long voyages. This practice helped popularise sauerkraut outside of Europe and spread its consumption to other parts of the world.During World War I and II, sauerkraut became a symbol of German culture, leading to a temporary decline in its popularity in the United States and other countries. However, in recent years, sauerkraut has experienced a resurgence in popularity due to its numerous health benefits and the growing interest in fermented foods.Today, sauerkraut is enjoyed around the world and is commonly used as a condiment, side dish, or ingredient in various dishes. It is a rich source of vitamins C and K, fibre, and beneficial bacteria that promote gut health.Sauerkraut is a fermented food made from cabbage that has a number of potential health benefits. Here are some of the main health benefits associated with consuming sauerkraut:Rich in probiotics: Sauerkraut is a great source of beneficial bacteria, also known as probiotics. These bacteria can help promote gut health, improve digestion, and strengthen the immune system.High in nutrients: Sauerkraut is rich in vitamins C and K, as well as other nutrients like fiber and antioxidants. Vitamin C is an important antioxidant that can help protect the body against damage from free radicals, while vitamin K is important for bone health and blood clotting.May help reduce inflammation: Some research suggests that the probiotics in sauerkraut may help reduce inflammation in the body. Inflammation is linked to a number of chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.May improve digestion: The probiotics in sauerkraut can help improve digestion by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria in the gut. This can lead to improved digestion and reduced symptoms of digestive issues like bloating, constipation, and diarrhea.May support weight loss: Sauerkraut is low in calories and high in fiber, which can help promote feelings of fullness and reduce overall calorie intake. This can be helpful for those trying to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight.May support heart health: The antioxidants in sauerkraut may help protect against heart disease by reducing inflammation and improving blood flow.It is important to note that while sauerkraut can be a healthy addition to your diet, some store-bought varieties may be high in sodium or preservatives. It is best to choose a low-sodium, naturally fermented variety or make your own sauerkraut at home.","food microbiology, food preservation, food science, kimchi, sauerkraut, vegetables"
Fermented foods,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",The gut-brain connection: How gut health impacts anxiety and mental health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-gut-brain-connection-how-gut-health-impacts-anxiety-and-mental-health/,"April 16, 2023","Introduction to the gut-brain connectionThe human body is an incredibly complex system, and it’s only in recent years that we’ve begun to understand the intricate connections between our organs and systems. One of the most fascinating of these is the gut-brain connection, which refers to the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. This connection is the reason why gut health is crucial for mental health and why an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to anxiety and depression.What is gut health and why is it important for mental health?Gut health refers to the balance of microorganisms in the gut, which includes bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These microorganisms play a crucial role in the body’s immune system, digestion, and overall health. When the balance of microorganisms in the gut is disrupted, it can lead to a range of health problems, including mental health issues.Research has shown that the gut is often referred to as the second brain, and it’s easy to see why. The gut contains over 100 million neurons, which communicate with the brain via the vagus nerve. This communication plays a vital role in regulating mood, behavior, and cognitive function.The gut microbiome and its impact on mental healthThe gut microbiome refers to the collection of microorganisms that live in the gut. This microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health, and research has shown that it also has a significant impact on mental health. The gut microbiome communicates with the brain via the gut-brain axis, which means that an imbalance in the microbiome can have a direct impact on mental health.Studies have shown that people with depression and anxiety often have an imbalance in their gut microbiome. This imbalance can lead to inflammation, which is a known contributor to mental health issues. Additionally, an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to nutrient deficiencies, which can further contribute to mental health problems.The link between gut health and anxietyAnxiety is a common mental health disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. While the causes of anxiety are complex and varied, research has shown that gut health plays a significant role in its development. Studies have found that people with anxiety often have an imbalance in their gut microbiome, which can lead to an increase in inflammation and a decrease in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin.Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood and behavior, and an imbalance in its production can lead to anxiety and depression. Additionally, the gut microbiome is responsible for the production of GABA, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in reducing anxiety.The link between gut health and depressionDepression is another common mental health disorder that is often linked to gut health. Like anxiety, depression is a complex condition with numerous contributing factors. However, research has shown that an imbalance in the gut microbiome can play a significant role in its development.Studies have found that people with depression often have a lower diversity of gut bacteria, which can lead to inflammation and a decrease in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. Additionally, an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to an increase in the production of stress hormones such as cortisol, which can further contribute to depression.The role of diet in gut health and mental healthDiet plays a vital role in maintaining gut health and can have a significant impact on mental health. A diet that is high in processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats can lead to an imbalance in the gut microbiome and an increase in inflammation. On the other hand, a diet that is rich in whole foods, fiber, and healthy fats can help to promote a healthy gut microbiome and reduce inflammation.Gut-friendly foods to improve mental healthThe following foods are excellent for promoting gut health and improving mental health:Fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, and kimchi, which are rich in probioticsPrebiotic foods such as garlic, onions, and asparagus, which help to feed the good bacteria in the gutFiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which help to promote a healthy gut microbiomeOmega-3 rich foods such as fatty fish, nuts, and seeds, which can help to reduce inflammation and promote healthy brain functionProbiotics and their impact on mental healthProbiotics are live microorganisms that can help to promote a healthy gut microbiome. Studies have shown that taking probiotics can help to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Additionally, probiotics can help to reduce inflammation, which is a known contributor to mental health issues.Lifestyle changes to improve gut health and mental healthIn addition to diet and probiotics, there are several lifestyle changes that people can make to promote gut health and improve mental health. These include:Reducing stress through practices such as meditation, yoga, and deep breathingGetting regular exercise, which can help to reduce inflammation and promote a healthy gut microbiomeGetting enough sleep, which is crucial for both gut health and mental healthAvoiding antibiotics unless absolutely necessary, as they can disrupt the gut microbiomeAvoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, which can disrupt gut healthConclusion: Taking care of your gut for better mental healthIn conclusion, the gut-brain connection is a fascinating and complex system that plays a crucial role in mental health. Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle changes can help to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression and promote better overall mental health. By taking care of your gut, you can take care of your mind.  If you’re struggling with anxiety or depression, take a look at your gut health. Making changes to your diet and lifestyle can have a significant impact on your mental health. Additionally, consider taking a probiotic supplement to help promote a healthy gut microbiome. Remember, taking care of your gut is crucial for taking care of your mind.","anxiety, depression, food microbiology, gut health, gut microbiome, gut microflora, gut-brain axis, mental health, probiotics"
Fermented foods,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Prebiotics and your gut microflora,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prebiotics-and-your-gut-microflora/,"February 10, 2023","The gut microflora is a diverse community of microorganisms that live in the gastrointestinal tract. It is composed of a variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms. The most prevalent and well-studied bacteria in the gut microflora are from the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.Examples of bacteria in the gut microflora include:Bifidobacterium: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut and is thought to have a number of health benefits, including improved digestion, a stronger immune system, and a reduced risk of certain diseases.Lactobacillus: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in fermented foods such as yogurt and kefir, and is also used as a probiotic supplement.Escherichia coli(E. coli): a type of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut and is important for maintaining a healthy gut microflora. Some strains ofE. coliare beneficial, while others can cause infections.Clostridium: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut, and is important for the digestion of carbohydrates.Bacteroides: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut, and is important for breaking down complex carbohydrates and proteins.It’s important to note that the gut microflora is a complex ecosystem and the number and type of bacteria present can vary greatly depending on factors such as diet, age, genetics, and overall health.Probiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed. The concept of using live microorganisms to promote health dates back to the early 20th century, when the Russian scientist Elie Metchnikoff observed that certain rural populations had longer lifespans and less incidence of disease than urban populations. He attributed this to their consumption of fermented dairy products, which he believed contained beneficial microorganisms. In the decades that followed, researchers began to isolate and study specific strains of microorganisms that they believed to have health benefits, leading to the development of probiotic supplements and products. Today, probiotics are available in a wide variety of forms, including capsules, tablets, powders, and fermented foods.Prebiotics are non-digestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the gut. They act as food for probiotics, helping to increase their numbers and improve their function.Examples of prebiotics include:Inulin: a type of fructan found in many fruits and vegetables, including onions, garlic, leeks, and asparagus.Oligosaccharides: a group of carbohydrates that includes fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). These can be found in a variety of foods, such as chicory root, Jerusalem artichokes, and soybeans.Resistant starches: a type of starch that is not broken down and absorbed in the small intestine, but instead reaches the large intestine where it can be fermented by gut bacteria. Examples include potatoes, green bananas, and legumes.Lactose: a sugar found in milk and dairy products, which is fermented by gut bacteria.Prebiotics are often added to food products such as yogurt, cereal, and energy bars, as well as supplements. They can also be found naturally in many fruits, vegetables and whole grains.Prebiotics are important for probiotic bacteria and the gut microflora because they provide a source of energy and nutrients that the beneficial microorganisms can use to grow and thrive. When prebiotics reach the large intestine, they are fermented by the gut bacteria, which produces short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate and butyrate that are essential for gut health.Prebiotics also help to promote a diverse and balanced gut microflora, which is important for maintaining gut health. A diverse gut microflora is associated with a healthy immune system, better nutrient absorption, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease.Additionally, prebiotics can improve the function of probiotics by helping to protect them from being broken down by stomach acid and bile, and also by providing an environment that supports their growth and survival.In summary, prebiotics play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy gut by providing a food source for beneficial gut bacteria, promoting diversity and balance of gut microflora, and protecting probiotic bacteria from degradation.The recommended daily intake of prebiotics varies depending on the specific type of prebiotic and the individual’s health status. However, a general guideline is to consume between 5-10 grams of prebiotics per day.It is also important to note that it is not necessary to consume prebiotics in the form of supplements, as they can be found naturally in many fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Examples of prebiotic-rich foods include:Jerusalem artichokesDandelion greensGarlicOnionsLeeksAsparagusBananas (ripe)Whole wheatBarleyOatsApplesBerriesIt is also important to note that it is best to consume a variety of prebiotic-rich foods to ensure that you are getting a diverse range of prebiotics to promote a diverse and balanced gut microflora.It is also worth noting that consuming too much prebiotics can cause digestive discomfort such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea. It’s best to start with small amounts and gradually increase the intake to see how your body reacts. Additionally, if you have any specific health conditions, it’s best to consult with a health professional before increasing your prebiotic intake.","food microbiology, food science, gut health, gut microflora, probiotics"
Fermented foods,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health","Prebiotics, probiotics and fermented foods",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prebiotics-probiotics-and-fermented-foods/,"August 27, 2022","After a four month break, we are back in the blogosphere!At some stage in the future, we plan to run a three-part webinar series on prebiotic, probiotics and fermented foods.  It’s like to be three monthly webinars, possibly over the Southern Hemisphere summer months of December, January and February.  If not the coming summer of 22/23, then quite likely the next summer of 23/24.Prebiotics, probiotics and fermented foods – they are separate and distinct, yet very much related, how so?  To get the most benefit from these three, it is essential to be clear on what they are, how they are similar, related and different.  Plus, how they relate to the other aspects of digestive or gut health as well as the gut microbiota, our microbiome altogether and indeed an appreciation, or at minimum, an acknowledgement or the wide-ranging influence the our gut health has on our overall and specific health and physiology.  While fermented foods date to antiquity, probiotics are a more recent concept, but are still certainly not new.  It really is just that they are returning to the fore, due to a heightened focus, not just on healthy eating and wellness, but on more natural approaches to maintaining a healthy homeostatic balance.  The immune system is a big topic at the moment, and our gut microbiota play a key immunomodulatory effect, in a very natural way.  How so and what can we do to maintain ourselves in top health by looking after our gut health?Well, probiotics are added ‘good’ and ‘friendly’ bacteria that are recognised, such as thorough clinical trials, to have a positive impact on the health of the person ingesting them.  Really though, probiotics could be thought of as a supplement, and shouldn’t really be necessary if you are looking after your natural and existing gut microbiome.  That’s where probiotics and fermented foods come in.  Prebiotics are really the nutrients that these gut bacteria require.  Various fibres that they thrive on, examples of which are inulin and especially the oligosaccharides known as GOS (galactic-oligosaccharides) and FOS (fructo-oligosaccharides).  These, and other prebiotic fibres, when consumed in appropriate quantities, should be able to sufficiently nourish your existing got microbiota.  This is the most natural approach, the simplest approach, and the ideal from the nutritional perspective too.  However, there might be times when your normal gut microbiome, which remember, can have an impact on various different parts of your body, might be negatively impacted by a range of circumstances.  These could include stress, a poor diet (or lifestyle overall) and/or taking of antibiotics.  Antibiotics in particular are bad news for your ‘friendly bacteria’ – once your antibiotics kill some of them off, your natural balance is disrupted and worst case scenario, the way is left open for invading pathogenic bacteria to establish.  Remember that your body constantly being challenged, whether it is by cancer cells or invading viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms.  Thus, with an out of balance gut microbial ecosystem, it’s only a matter of time that you become sick from the constant challenges of invading microorganisms.Under such circumstances, probiotics can be useful, either in foods, which may or may not be fermented, or as dietary supplements, like capsules and the like.  However, the best way to externally restore your gut microbial balance is with probiotic foods, which may or may not be fermented.  This is an important, really essential piece of understanding to gain here, which is – fermented foods are always going to be produced by microorganisms, because this is the nature of fermentation, it is a microbial process.  However, those fermented foods may or may not contain probiotics, even if the starter culture microorganisms are still present.  On the other hand, probiotic foods may or may not be fermented.  Today, there are many new and innovative probiotic food products that contain probiotics that are not fermented.  These have a range of probiotics added to them, essentially they are food additives.  A classic example is kombucha, the very popular and trending low to non-alcohol fermented beverage.  The natural fermenting starter cultures in kombucha are acetic acid bacteria.  Acetic acid bacteria do a fabulous job of fermenting sugars into acetic acid during the manufacturing process of kombucha.  While they are perfectly suited to fermentation in this context, they are not probiotic bacteria and will do nothing to improve the gut health or any other aspects of health, of the host.  Then, you might be asking, but I drink probiotic kombucha, it says probiotic on the label and it is a fermented drink.  Yes it is a fermented drink and yes it may be probiotic, but the two are unrelated.  This means that probiotics are added to kombucha.  The fermenting starter acetic acid bacteria cultures may or may not be present when you consume the drink, but it is irrelevant because they are not probiotics.We given an extremely brief overview here, but tried to convey the important consumer-related aspect of the difference and relatedness between probiotics foods/drinks and fermented foods/drinks, and how they are the same and different.","food microbiology, gut health, microbiology, probiotics"
Fermented foods,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Prospective probiotic food alternatives,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prospective-probiotic-food-alternatives/,"March 12, 2022","Probiotics, digestive health and the gut microbiota are absolutely essential to health and wellness.  They really are cornerstones to maintaining a steady state of physical and mental health.  While this aspect may not always have been known, the benefits of fermented foods in general has been long known.  It’s always important to point out the distinction between probiotic foods and fermented foods.  A food can be probiotic, but not fermented food.  This would be when probiotics are added.  On the other hand, we can have a fermented food that is not (naturally) probiotic.  An example is kombucha.  Of course there are some foods which are fermented and probiotic, where they microorganisms that engage in the fermentation process, also provide health benefits to the host.  Foods for delivery of probiotics is so, so important.  This of course changes from country to country, and region to region, depending on the local palate and seasonality, for example.  This piece on the types of probiotic foods, as alternatives to the traditional probiotic foods of yogurt and kimchi for example, was written by Amy Tsang in 2008, a 3rd-year food science student at RMIT University.  While it is not an up-to-date account of probiotic food innovations, the ideas may stimulate thinking for your own new probiotic food development project.It is quite challenging to develop palatable and socially acceptable probiotic products for consumption, especially for non-dairy probiotic foods due to the bacteria’s sensitive character towards processing methods. Successfully manufacturing non dairy probiotics can be highly reliant upon the food matrix, these factors can consist of; pH level, storage temperature, oxygen levels and presence of competing organisms and inhibitors (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002). As cited in (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002) a method to overcome probiotic instability in non-dairy probiotics, is to introduce a method referred to as probiotic encapsulation technology. This method although successful in promoting stability of probiotic bacteria in non-dairy products; it was not utilized in any of the research papers analysed below, however the method was mentioned by (Yoon et. al, 2006).Probiotic products should be made available to suit all diets; vegetarians and consumers who suffer from diseases and allergies. As cited in (Heenan et. al, 2004) “probiotics are usually marketed in the form of fermented milks and yoghurts; however, with an increase in consumer vegetarianism throughout the country, there is a demand for vegetarian probiotic products.”The criteria for vegetarian probiotic products is simple, no animal-derived ingredients are to be used in the production process. According to (Heenan, et. al, 2004) this also applies to the media used to culture the probiotic organisms, and any ingredients used for preservation or storage. A study conducted by (Heenan, et. al, 2004) looked into a non- fermented vegetarian frozen soy dessert, and analysed the survival of probiotic organisms and sensory differences over a 6 month period. The study found that many of the probiotic bacteria such asLactobacillus acidophilus,L. rhamnosisandBifidobacterium lactissurvived the frozen conditions quite well and the numbers of viable cells were still above the minimum requirement of 107cfu/g. As for the sensory attributes, the soy- based dessert containingL. acidophilusdeveloped off-flavours (Heenan et. al, 2004).Another example of a non-dairy probiotic product is the development of a new oat-based probiotic drink, in this study (Angelov et. al, 2006) have attempted to develop a symbiotic drink derived from whole grain oat substrate and probiotic starter culture. This drink combines a good source of beta-glucan (functional constituent of cereal fibers) with probiotic cultures (Angelov et. al, 2006), because oats have a low glycemic index, this drink may be beneficial to patients who suffer from diabetes.Another probiotic alternative was under evaluation;B. brevestrain Yakult in fermented soymilk, this study focused on the capability ofB. brevestrain Yakult to grow in fermented soymilk and investigated the vivo recovery of the administered strain from faeces (Shimakawa et. al, 2003). The results for this investigation revealed that theB. brevestrain Yakult was present in high numbers after consumption; through faecal recovery. It was stated that:” the fermented soy-milk would be an excellent vehicle for live Bifidobacterium” (Shimakawa et. al, 2003, discussion section).Red beets were also analysed as a substrate for the creation of beet juice by four species of lactic acid bacteria;Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus plantarum(Yoon et. al, 2005). The results concluded that large beets could be used to produce beet juice by lactic acid fermentation withL. acidophilusorL. plantarum(Yoon, et. al, 2005). In addition to beet juice, cabbage juice was also investigated; the completed results concluded thatL. plantarumandL. delbrueckiicould be used as probiotic cultures, furthermore emphasise was placed cabbage juice as a healthy alternative for vegetarians and consumers who were allergic to lactose present in dairy products (Yoon, et. al, 2006).ReferencesAngelov, A., Gotcheva, V., Kuncheva, R., Hristozova, T., 2006, ‘Development of a new oat-based probiotic drink,’International Journal of Food Microbiology,vol. 112, pp.75-80.Heenan., C.

Fermented foods,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, public-health",Part 2 of antibiotic resistance,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/part-2-of-antibiotic-resistance/,"December 3, 2021","Antibiotic resistance is a significant global challenge, fast becoming one of this century’s most significant issues.  Not only does it have concerns in human and veterinary medicine, in agriculture and food science, but in public health too.  We must act now to stem the tide, the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, before it becomes an insurmountable obstacle and drives the demise of humanity, of civilisation.Let us launch straight into the concerns of antibiotic use for our own personal health…Another important problem is associated with our own microbiome, primarily our gut microbiome, since many antibiotics are taken orally.  Unfortunately, a substantial number of antibiotics are prescribed rapidly and without reference to any antimicrobial sensitivity testing.  Under such circumstances, patients almost demand an antibiotic prescription after visiting a clinician.  The medico, under this kind of pressure from their patient, doesn’t have the time to wait up to 48 hours (or longer) for an antimicrobial sensitivity test result, typically doesn’t even request a sample, rather, prescribes a broad spectrum antibiotic, often based on nothing more than clinical observation and possible symptom history, which may be sometimes unreliable.  While this is a quick and easy way to satisfy a patient, it is harmful in multiple ways.  For example, indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics will contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes during active infections and among human and environmental reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria.  Furthermore, the patient will be unaware that taking a broad spectrum antibiotic may or may not eliminate the bacteria troubling them, but even if it does, it is highly likely to do untold damage to the host’s own flora, their microbial ecosystem.  This could open the patient up to side effects or additional infections, once the protection, primarily from the gut microbiota is severely disrupted.  Severely disrupted to the stage where opportunistic pathogenic bacteria could gain a ‘foothold’, resulting in an additional and subsequent infection(s).  So, indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics is certainly highly likely to do more harm (in the longer term) than good (n the shorter term).The way microorganisms can potentially address this, while largely unknown, would surely lie within the immense unknown prokaryotic diversity that remains to be discovered.  A few years ago,Locey and Lennon (2016)provided an updated estimation of the total prokaryotic species on our planet, which they said, is likely to be in excess of one trillion.  We currently are aware of an absolute minuscule proportion of this estimated total.  Therefore, simply by intensifying research investigations of extreme environments for yet-to-be discovered microbes and developing means to actually culture them, is likely to hold a key to humanity’s success.  Just through a trial and error investigation of the microbial world, we are highly likely to unlock some prokaryotic secrets that could hold value in addressing our global challenges.  Really, it could very well be a numbers game – with so many undiscovered species and undiscovered potential, the answers are likely to be there, if we look long and hard enough.  An important element of this though is keeping an open mind.  Keeping an open mind with regard to what we are looking for, where we look for it, how we look for it, how they are cultured and more.  If we don’t, we could very well miss the opportunity of a lifetime to change the course of humanity.  It takes sharpness, alertness and looking at situations from a different perspective to be able to recognise potential.  IfAlexander Fleming hadn’t noticed on 28 September 1928that a contaminating mould was inhibiting the growth of an important human pathogenic bacterium, the world would be a different place today.  He could have easily seen the contaminating mould on that agar plate, thrown it away, and an opportunity to change the course of humanity would have been lost.Scouring the unexplored microbial world for compounds of potential use which can be used to address human challenges is one aspect, and a key area where global efforts should be directed.  However, as old as fermented foods and probiotics are, they hold much potential to further address issues of public health associated with diet, which really, is the cornerstone to good health of everyone.  Even though each of us contain untold diversity in our own microbiome, it is still not well understood.  Innovative analytical methods are needed to improve characterisation of the human microbiome.  Furthermore, the way it is linked to a range of elements and indicators of health needs to be elucidated.  This could result in targeted food product development activities and direct public health messages, based on sound science, around what will be beneficial for health within the context of today’s lifestyle.  Furthermore, fermented foods are trending and this trend and positive image by consumers should be explored further to produce diverse fermented foods that are able to bring great public health benefits while satisfying people’s increasing desire for exotic tastes with new foods.  There are countless microorganisms of fermentative potential, and numerous types of food substrates that could be used to develop a wide range of natural and healthy foods. Consumers’ positivity towards fermented foods and beverages should really be explored further to bring them products likely to gain rapid market acceptance.  The idea is that with improved public health from improved personal health resulting from healthier eating of diverse food products of microbial origin, there would be less reliance on antibiotics.","agriculture, antibiotic resistance, food microbiology, human medicine, microbiology, probiotics, veterinary medicine"

Fermented foods,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Probiotics and their viability in foods and gastrointestinal passage.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/probiotics-and-their-viability-in-foods-and-gastrointestinal-passage/,"January 4, 2021","The text of this blog article was originally written by Amy Tsang, a 3rd-year food technology student of mine at RMIT University in 2009.  I have provided some slight updates/changes/revisions.While probiotics now exist (for example,Bacilluscoagulans) that are able to withstand pasteurisation and high pressure processing, there’s no doubt of the ongoing importance of the issue of viability of probiotics, given adequate amounts of the organisms reaching the appropriate place in the gastrointestinal tract is a requisite for their success, and the multitude of factors that can negatively impact probiotic survival during manufacture, in food and during gastrointestinal passage, as noted in the image above.Probiotics continue to attracted much interest from consumers; who are concerned with their personal diet and lifestyle. These consumers expect that the functional foods they consume will exert clear health benefits for their digestive system; especially in Europe where gut health is a key component for the benefits provided by functional foods (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002). Future research into probiotics may also help to alleviate many health issues such as allergies or even particular types of cancers. Currently there are many studies focused on probiotic survival through the gastrointestinal environment.Misconceptions about probiotics need to be defended when placed under scrutiny (Gorbach, 2002). To counter misconceptions of probiotics, detailed research and human/clinical studies need to be conducted by scientists to prove to consumers that probiotics have health promoting properties. In addition, consumer education is also important; if probiotics were to become a part of the daily diet; appropriate scientific facts and information should be made readily available for consumers. Without consumer confidence, the probiotic industry would not prosper.There are several major issues that need to be addressed before developing new probiotic products or re-formulating products for consumption.  The viability and stability of probiotics and maintaining an acceptable number of viable cells above food standard requirements throughout the whole shelf life of the product and ensuring specific probiotic strains are chosen that can withstand the gastrointestinal stresses present in that environment; these have all been major challenges for the food industry (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002). These requirements highlight the need for innovative solutions such as new technological advancements; however maintenance of low production costs will also be high on the agenda as the solutions need to be financially viable for food manufacturers and consumers alike.Yoghurt, a popular dairy product with probiotic health benefits, has established the foundations for further research into other potential probiotic functional foods such as; probiotic drinks, non dairy beverages; vegetable and fruit juices, desserts for vegetarians, baby foods, and cereal based products (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002; Heenan, 2004 et. al; Prado et. al, 2008; Lee & Salminen, 1995).Various ideas towards the method of benefit offered by probiotics have been hypothesised. Although these significant methods have not been completely established, the possibilities include; rivalry for nutrients, secretion of microbial substances, blocking of adhesion sites, decrease in virulence, blocking of toxin receptor sites, immune stimulation and suppression of toxin production (Fooks et. al, 1999). The competition for nutrients is quite a significant factor for any bacteria thriving in the gastrointestinal tract. Various bacterial species are quite specific in their nutritional requirements and so one particular population may deplete nutrients at the expense of another species (Fooks et. al, 1999); thus if probiotics were used in this circumstance it would be highly beneficial to the gut flora, where health promoting bacteria may predominate. In general terms, probiotic foods and supplements are expected to restore the balance in the gut; given there are sufficient numbers, which is generally 106cfu/g (Elahi et.al, 2008; Lee & Salminen, 1996).Probiotic effectiveness can be further enhanced with the inclusion of probiotics for a symbiotic effect. According to (Fooks et. al, 1999) this combination of one probiotic with another probiotic can enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria overall.To further highlight the importance of probiotic bacterial survival, there are also other issues to consider. Although probiotic bacteria in food products may be able to survive the initial fermentation, production process; the storage and the gastrointestinal tract are also of great concern, probiotic bacteria may be susceptible to extreme and harsh environments. As discussed by (Lacroix & Yildirim, 2007) the storage conditions can have an impact on probiotic bacteria such as oxygen stress, competition with other organisms, variability in temperature and moisture content, given that the probiotic bacteria do survive during storage they are then exposed to the gastrointestinal tract.Furthermore, the gastrointestinal tract will have extreme acidic conditions present in the stomach and enzyme activity will be present, thus the composition of the environment may not favour the probiotic bacteria and presence of bile salts in the small intestine may inhibit the growth of the probiotic bacteria ingested (Lacroix & Yildirim, 2007). These are typical stresses which probiotic bacteria may be subjected to, therefore probiotic bacteria chosen for products should be those that can adapt to extreme conditions and changing environments (Lacroix & Yildirim, 2007). Therefore due to such conditions, it is not always likely that sufficient numbers of probiotic bacteria will reach the appropriate gut location to exert their beneficial health effects. A research project was conducted by (Gibson & Brostoff, 2005 – apologies, citation details cannot be found!) to test commercially available supplements that contained strains of probiotic bacteria and their survival in the gastrointestinal environment. Their results demonstrated thatLactobacillus spp.were resistant to the gastric environment, however they were sensitive to the upper intestinal content, on the contraryBifidobacterium spp.displayed sensitivity to the stomach environment but were able to survive well in the upper intestine. This study highlighted the significance of different probiotic species and their diverse capacity to survive within the intestinal environment.ReferencesElahi, S., Farnell, P., Thurlow, K.

Fermented foods,"fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Probiotics and mental health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/probiotics-and-mental-health/,"December 19, 2020","Deep into the festive period now and six days to Christmas in this crazy pandemic year!  What a year it has been, exceptionally good for some, exceptionally bad for some.  For those that have done it tough, mental health issues have been prominent in issues mentioned as a consequence of this pandemic.  If you’ve still got your health and your financial stability and securing, there are certainly chances that your mental state may have been compromised during the course of this year.  Of course, this may still be the case into 2021, with ongoing uncertainty.Mental health and mental wellbeing is prominent in today’s society, at least in Australia where I am located.  It is openly seen as a key indicator of good health these days, along with the more traditional physical health metric.  Of course, spiritual health comes into it too, but for now, let us focus on mental health.While the health benefits of probiotics have been speculated/noted for an extremely long time, it has tended to focus on gut and digestive health.  This is natural, because probiotics are administered and expected to exert their benefits in the gastrointestinal tract and, for the most part, become part of the host’s gut microbiome.  While there are some probiotics that tend to be more transient in nature, such asSachharomyces boulardii, many probiotics are administered for the purpose of restoring the host’s normal flora and hence restoring digestive health.  Over the years, there has been a mind-boggling amount of research on probiotics, to the extent that some are skeptical of their benefits.  Like anything, while it is certainly true that some people tend to ‘jump the gun’ and share or promote non-evidence-based therapeutics, there is mounting evidence in many different areas for the benefits of probiotics.  One of these areas is mental health.There’s no doubt that there is a relationship between food and mood, as backed up for the academic centre of that name at Deakin University in Melbourne.  However, a resulting good mood goes beyond just eating so-called ‘comfort food’ that makes us feel better, or eating chocolate when we feel down or ‘blue’.  There is actually scientific evidence for the benefits for the benefits of probiotics and the positive effects they can have on mental health.  Remember that these probiotic foods may or may not be fermented.  With the development of processing-stable probiotics, such as a specifically developedBacillus coagulanssold by Kerry Ingredients, there are an increasing amount of non-fermented probiotic foods available today.  These are foods where the probiotic component is really a food additive, untreated to the production of the food.  They are incorporated during processing, typically earlier on, and able to withstand HTST (high temperature short time) pasteurisation and HPP (high pressure processing), which, in the case of a fermented food, would eliminate the starter culture.Treat these few paragraphs as a bit of an introduction to this fascinating area and follow the link below to my blog article on this topic which was published on the TCLH website five days ago.https://www.tclh.com.au/blog/how-to-stay-healthy-over-the-christmas-period",
Fermented foods,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, yeast",Kombucha is not naturally probiotic.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/kombucha-is-not-naturally-a-probiotic-product/,"November 13, 2020","This topic is in a pretty hot space, because both kombucha and probiotics are very much ‘in fashion’ and trending at the present time across the worldwide, as can be seen in the all-time Google Trends for this word which has showed a slow rise over the last seven years, peaking this year during the third week of January (Figure 1).  Leading the way in search interest on Google for “kombucha” are New Zealand, followed by Australia (Figure 2).  This shows how interest in kombucha is at an all-time high in 2020, especially in New Zealand and Australia, followed by Canada and the United States.  Google interest in “probiotics” has shown an increase ever since records began (Figure 3), with a peak at a similar time earlier this year (late January/early February).  Search interest from Australia (5th) and New Zealand (6th) still ranks highly, although the United States (2nd) and Canada (4th) rank higher, with Singapore at number three.  Perhaps surprising is Trinidad and Tobago at number one – small sample size perhaps?  In any case, kombucha and probiotics are of much interest, particularly from westernised nations of the world with advanced economies.Figure 1: Global Google Trends for “kombucha”.Figure 2: Top five countries searching for “kombucha” on Google Trends.Figure 3: Global Google Trends for “probiotic”.Figure 4: Top five countries for “probiotic” on Google Trends.This strong interest, resurgence is fascinating, given the age-old origins of both kombucha and provides, essentially stretching back millennia for kombucha in particular.  At this stage I want to introduce the distinction between probiotic foods and beverages and fermented foods and beverages.  While there is certainly overlap, in many instances, they are certainly not interchangeable terms.  Let us just consider that all foods/beverages could be categorised as:Fermented and probiotic – for example most yogurts and kimchi.Non-fermented and probiotic – for example some popcorn and some protein bars.Fermented and non-probiotic – for example natural kombucha and sourdough bread.Non-fermented and non-probiotic – for example peanut butter or ice cream.Kombucha is naturally, a fermented and non-probiotic beverage (tea) of ancient Chinese origin with consumption for “magical” properties being known from the Qin dynasty (around 220 BC) with subsequent historical consumption in China, Germany and Russia (Greenwaltet al., 2000).  However even today, despite mass consumption as a functional food for various postulated health benefits, no real evidence of any health benefits exists in the human contextin vivoalthough promising results have been seenin vitroand with animal models (Figure 5) (Moraleset al., 2020).Figure 5: Laboratory testing, animal models and human success to demonstrate health benefits of kombucha. Source: Morales et al. (2020).Kombucha is produced by what is referred to as a SCOBY, aSymbioticCultureOfBacteria andYeasts and is widely known in consumer circles as “tea fungus” (Figure).  Within this symbiotic community (Figures 6 and 7), bacterial diversity is limited to mostly species ofAcetobacterwhile a myriad of yeast species are likely to be present (Teohet al., 2004).  A detailed review by Moraleset al.(2020) has identified the following microorganism groups isolated from kombucha; 22 species of acetic acid bacteria from six genera, 3 species of lactic acid bacteria from two genera and 41 species of yeast from 21 genera –AcetobacterandGluconacetobacterare the bacterial genera with the most species isolated from kombucha whileHanseniasporaandZygosaccharomycesare the yeast genera with the most species isolated.Figure 6: An advanced fermentative state of kombucha (Source: Jayabalanet al., 2014).Figure 7: Microscopic view of SCOBY.  Source: Greenwaltet al.(2000).So, while kombucha is indeed a fermented beverage, it is not fermented with probiotic microorganisms – it is fermented with yeasts and acetic acid bacteria that do not have any demonstrated probiotic benefit.  Therefore, their only role is to turn tea into kombucha through their growth and metabolic activity, thus producing a variety of compounds in the process (Figure 8).  Thus, while you may in fact be consuming live culture in kombucha, these microorganisms that have been used to make kombucha will do little for your gut wellbeing.  From studies conducted on the microbial content of kombucha, there is admittedly some lactic acid bacteria present sometimes, however while they MAY be probiotic, they are most likely present at too low a concentration to confer any health benefit to to the host, which is of course a key element of the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of probiotics.Figure 8: How acetic acid bacteria and yeast ferment tea into kombucha.  Source: Tranet al.(2020).Manufacturers have thus sought to capitalise on the probiotic image of kombucha through the addition of probiotics to the product, that have no role in actually making the product.  This is fine, but it’s worth knowing that such probiotics are an additive because as mentioned above, they do not function in the fermentation process.  Therefore, from this perspective, kombucha has little difference from any other probiotic food or drink to which probiotics are added, to make them probiotic products, of which there are diverse types on the market these days, such as popcorn (Figure 9).Figure 9: A probiotic popcorn product on sale in a Melbourne supermarket. Photo by @pdbuttonLast point, read the science, believe the science and remember to only trust credible sources so as not to be misled by erroneous information that is more easily found online (Figure 10).  While kombucha might be delicious, they are not naturally probiotic and need to be made probiotic through the addition of probiotics (therefore, read the label and see if it is probiotic or a fermented beverage only) and there is certainly no robust evidence that kombucha has any human health benefits, despite such claims below in the popular health media online.Figure 10: An erroneous “blanket” reference to the probiotic and other health properties for all kombucha products.ReferencesGreenwalt, C.

Fermented foods,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Improving the survivability of probiotic bacteria,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/improving-the-survivability-of-probiotic-bacteria/,"September 9, 2020","This article is an extract from a literature review written by Louise Sidharta, a 3rd-year undergraduate student I was supervising at RMIT University in 2009.Introductory comments by Dr Philip Button.For probiotic bacteria to exert their positive effects, they need to survive many hostile (micro)environments before they reach the location in the gastrointestinal tract where they are needed.  Food processing conditions, temperate fluctuations during the post-manufacture supply chain, intrinsic conditions in the food and the gastrointestinal tract all provide challenges.  To deliver the maximum amount of probiotics right their site of action can pose a great challenge to food microbiologists – these are some of the strategies they can employ to ensure the highest percentage of survival.  Let’s now hear from Louise…Strain selectionAs mentioned previously, the ability to survive through the acid in the human stomach and bile in the intestine is one of the most important characteristics of probiotic bacteria. A number of studies on the survival ofL. acidophilus(Figure 1) andBifidobacteriumspp. in the presence of acid and bile salts have been carried out by several investigators (Conway, Gorbach, & Goldin, 1987; Gilliland, Staley, & Bush, 1984; Holcomb, Frank, & McGregor, 1991; Ibrahim & Bezkorovainy, 1993). Clark & Martin (1994) reported thatB. longumtolerated bile concentrations of as high as 4.0%, whereas Ibrahim & Bezkorovainy (1993) foundB. longumto be the least resistant to bile. Furthermore, three out of six CSIRO strains of lactobacilli showed the best survivability under acidic conditions and two strains showed the best tolerance to bile (Lankaputhra & Shah, 1995). Therefore, careful selection of strains on the basis of acid and bile tolerance would help improve the survivabilityensure the required minimum amount of probiotic bacteria in a given product.Figure 1:Lactobacillus acidophilusTwo-step fermentationThe composition of the yoghurt cultures participating in the fermentation has been suspected postulated to affect the survival ofL. acidophilusandBifidobacteriumspp., causing their severe viability losses during storage (Shah, 2000). Inhibitory substances such as acid and hydrogen peroxide produced by yoghurt cultures are the major cause of this problem, as explained by Hull, Roberts, & Mayes (1984). Nevertheless, these cultures are prerequisite in yoghurt manufacture as they are responsible for the typical yoghurt flavour. Lankaputhra & Shah (1997) suggested two-stage fermentation as means of improving the viability of probiotic bacteria. Results from this study showed that fermentation with probiotic bacteria followed by fermentation with yoghurt cultures brings a significant increase in the initial and final counts of probiotic bacteria. The initial counts have been found to increase by 4 to 5 times and the final counts ofL. acidophilus2409 andB. longum1941 following 6 weeks of storage were 6.85 and 7.93 log cfu/g and 7.60 and 8.84 cfu/g for yoghurt prepared by single and two-stage fermentation, respectively.Oxygen impermeable packagingL. acidophilusis microaerophilic andBifidobacteriumspp. are strictly anaerobic. Oxygen affects the probiotic cultures in two ways; by direct or indirect toxicity to cells (Dave & Shah, 1997). Direct toxicity is presumably due to the intracellular production of hydrogen peroxide, while indirect toxicity is caused by the production of hydrogen peroxide by other cultures in the environment such asL. delbrueckii(Villegas & Gilliland, 1998). One way to prevent the detrimental effects of oxygen on the probiotic cultures is through the use of oxygen-impermeable packaging. Dave & Shah (1997) reported a higher increase in numbers and survival ofL. acidophilusduring storage in yoghurts made in plastic containers rather than glass. Bifidobacteria showed higher survival in glass bottles than in plastic cups. To be exact, the initial counts of the bifidobacteria population were 1.6 fold higher in yoghurt prepared in glass bottles than plastic cups, although the acid contents were similar in both samples. Klaveret al. (1993) observed better survival and viability of bifidobacteria in deaerated milk.MicroencapsulationMicroencapsulation technology has been under special consideration and investigation as an effective approach to enhance the survival rate of probiotic bacteria in acidic products (Figure 2) such as dairy fermented products (Kailasapathy, 2002; Krasaekoopt, Bhandari, & Deeth, 2003). Shahidi & Han (1993) define microencapsulation as “a technology of packaging solids, liquid or gaseous materials in miniature, sealed capsules that can release their contents at controlled rates under the influence of specific conditions”. Another definition from a microbiological point of view defines microencapsulation as “the process of entrapment/enclosure of microbial cells by means of coating them with proper hydrocolloid(s) in order to segregate the cells from the surrounding environment; in a way that results in appropriate cell release in the intestinal medium” (Sultanaet al., 2000; Krasaekooptet al., 2003; Picot & Lacroix, 2003).  Microencapsulation has been shown to protect the probiotic bacterial cells against the influences of adverse environmental factors such as high acidity and low pH (Sun & Griffiths, 2000), bile salts (Lee & Heo, 2000), cold shocks caused by deep freezing and freeze drying (Shah & Ravula, 2000), molecular oxygen in case of strictly anaerobic microorganisms likeBifidobacteriumspp. (Sunoharaet al., 1995), and heat shocks caused by spray drying (Steensonet al., 1987). According to Anal & Singh (2007), the most commonly used encapsulant materials in microencapsulation are food-grade polymers such as alginate, chitosan, κ-carrageenan and gelatin.Figure 2: How microencapsulation can help probiotic survival.ReferencesAnal, A.

Fermented foods,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage, probiotics-and-gut-health, public-health, viruses",Career mentoring in food microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/career-mentoring-in-food-microbiology/,"August 26, 2020","While I am passionate about the training and guidance of young people, and have been so since I first set foot in a teaching laboratory as an instructor 20 years ago, mentoring isn’t really something I’ve done a lot of, and can say I’ve never actually pursued opportunities to offer such guidance to aspiring food microbiologists.The interesting aspect is of course you never know where and when opportunities will present.  A few weeks ago, I started moving our video content to our new Brand YouTube channel, with the first (and so far the only!) video on our channel being  on my career in food microbiology.  In fact, this video formed the basis of our vlog posted on May 24, which is located here:http://foodmicrobiology.academy/2020/05/24/my-food-microbiology-career/.So anyway, a few days ago my video was found by a (very) young aspiring food microbiologist in Mumbai, India.  This teenage student made some comments to initiate a conversation with my around career advice and guidance, then we continue our discussions through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.  Now, we’re about to formalise our discussions with a mentoring agreement.  This is just great news and of mutual benefit as she can clearly gain from my years on a non-traditional career path and I real feel like I’m ‘giving back’ and encouraging and ‘grooming’ the next generation of passionate food microbiologists to come along and really take on the challenges of the world and solve them, which we can all really achieve together.  This student is pretty amazing because even at her young age, she has a career vision and a firm goal of wanting to work in the area of food safety and foodborne diseases at the World Health Organization.  With such a plan at such an early age, she can so get there as well.  What I wanted this blog post to be was to introduce the career mentoring thatFood Microbiology Academynow offers by elaborating on some of the examples I provided to this mentee during our early discussions.Firstly, too many people, myself included years ago in the mid to late 1990s, have a general career idea but no firm goal and vision.  Without this, you do almost wander aimlessly to some extent.  Thus, I would say – don’t worry about or try and identify what you will study as your undergraduate degree and where until you have identified your dream job.  Then, you can work backwards.  Setting your dream job as your goal will help answer so many questions, such as:Which is the highest degree I’ll need?Do I need to do a Master degree?  if so, should it be a research or coursework Master degree?Which country should I complete my various degrees in?What should my undergraduate degree be in?What sort of opportunities should I seek during holidays or internships to support me reaching my career goal(s)?For example, if you have come to the conclusion that you need a PhD, does the Australian (three years, one laboratory, research only) or North American (four years, laboratory rotations during the first year, 25% coursework) model work better for you and your career.  Then, for training like a PhD, the importance of factors that you should consider can be ranked like this, from most important to least important: Supervisor > Laboratory > Department > University > Country.  Some people get to hung up over doing their PhD in a particular country or a particular university.  However, it is the supervisor that is most critical and I’m sure you can find exceptional academic supervisors leading world-class research groups engaging in cutting edge discoveries located in what many would consider sub-standard universities or lower ranking countries for research training or higher education in general.However, you may not even be at the stage where you can identify your ideal or dream job, but you just have a hankering for food microbiology.  In such case, perhaps consider the following, as a non-exhaustive list of careers in food microbiology that require high levels of responsibility, so senior positions that typical require a PhD:I)Teaching food microbiology in a college/university(professor in a community college).II)Doing food safety research in a university(research-only academic position, like Research Assistant Professor or Senior Research Fellow, in a research-intensive university).III)Teaching food microbiology and doing food safety research in a university(traditional academic position).IV)Doing food safety research and development in a food manufacturing company(only food manufacturing companies of substantial size, like Nestlé would engage in such R&D)V)Consulting and therefore providing advice to small and medium size food companies on keeping their products safe(either as an independent consultant or working for a scientific consulting firm).VI)Managing food safety at a large food manufacturing company(this may be part of a quality management role of if the food manufacturing operation is large enough, then it would be a seperate position).VII)Tracking foodborne diseases and identifying sources of outbreaks(such as at a government health organisation, which could be at a national level like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States or the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory in the Australian state of Victoria)VIII)Developing public health strategies and government policy to reduce foodborne disease(an advisory role in government to assemble scientific information and make recommendations for policy and legislative changes to protect the health of the citizens under the jurisdiction of the government you’re working for).So, if you’re a budding food microbiologist (no pun intended!) or simply want to find out more about careers and working in our field, do contact myself (Dr Philip Button, @pdbutton, by e-mail to philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academy).","career, career choice, food microbiologist, mentoring"
Fermented foods,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, viruses",Where to obtain maximum probiotic benefits.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/where-to-obtain-maximum-probiotic-benefits/,"August 4, 2020","Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, “immune system” has been a buzzword around us! Recovery from this disease in most cases has largely been reliant on the human body’s natural defence, the immune system. A whopping 70% of our immune system activity is located in our gut. Bacteria in the intestine may help regulate immune cell activity, which allows probiotics to be potentially helpful for supporting immune function. Clinical evidence shows that certain probiotic strains help to prevent bacterial and viral infections, including gastroenteritis, sepsis, and respiratory tract infections.What are probiotics ?Probiotics are “live microorganisms  when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.” The concept of probiotic bacteria is very old, and is associated with the consumption of fermented foods by human beings, for thousands of years. Recently, new types of food products containing probiotic bacteria have started to be introduced into the market, including non-dairy products, such as chocolate, cereals, beverages, fruits and vegetables products. In the near future, a wide range of non-traditional food products containing probiotic bacteria are expected to be introduced into the market.How Probiotics Act ?As mentioned in an earlier blog article, probiotics have various mechanisms of action. Probiotic microorganisms can be elucidated by promotion of digestion and uptake of dietary nutrients, strengthening of intestinal barrier function, modulation of the innate and acquired immune response of the host, production of antimicrobial substances and competition with pathogens for binding sites. In addition probiotics show adhesion and colonization of the different sites of the human body which may increase their retention time thus providing prolonged probiotic activity.Probiotics  produce substances that inhibit pathogens – low-molecular weight substances – bacteriocins, antibiotics and microcins. Lactic acid bacteria produce a variety of substances that exhibit antagonistic activity against other bacteria.Various Probiotic ProductsDairy probiotic products:-Milk is an excellent medium to carry or generate live and active probiotics through various cultured dairy products. The buffering capacity of milk helps to improve the survival of probiotic flora in the GI tract. Currently hundreds of probiotic dairy products are manufactured and consumed around the world, examples are as follows.Yoghurt– About 80% of the population use yoghurt for direct consumption or as a food supplement daily. A characteristic feature of this product is the addition of starters of pure cultures ofStreptococcus thermophilusandLactobacillus delbrueckiissp.Bulgaricusfor conducting lactic acid fermentation.  These traditional lactic acid bacteria have a positive effect on the body, which is a result of the formed metabolites, which inhibit the putrefactive and pathogenic flora or of the improvement of the utilization of lactose. In last decade many new flavours have been incorporated in yoghurts in order to attract consumers.Ice cream– The incorporation of probiotic cultures into ice cream results in adding value to the ice cream product and it being considered as a functional product. The ice cream composition, which includes milk, incorporating proteins, fat and lactose, as well as other compounds, make ice cream a good vehicle for probiotic cultures. During probiotic ice cream development, the ultimate aim of processes optimization is to enhance and maintain the probiotic survivability, ice cream being relatively high in pH at values of 5.5 to 6.5 leads to an increased survival of the probiotic bacteria upon storage.Cheese– Cheese provides a valuable alternative as a food vehicle for probiotic delivery. Its high protein content provides probiotic bacteria with a good buffering protection against the high acidic condition in the gastrointestinal tract, and thus enhances probiotic bacterial survival throughout gastric transit. Cheddar cheese is a good carrier to deliverEnterococcus faeciuminto the gastrointestinal tract of humans.Kefir– Kefir is a traditional popular beverage consumed for thousands of years in the Central Asia and Middle East countries. It is an acidic-alcoholic fermented milk product, with uniform creamy consistency and a slight sour taste. Milk is fermented with kefir grains, it usually contain lactose-fermenting yeastsKluyveromyces lactis, K. marxianusandTorula kefir.Lactobacillus, Lactococcus,andLeuconostoc; acetic acid bacteria and a further yeast mixture are typical inclusions. Kefir is rich in vitamins B1, B12, folic acid, vitamin K, and biotin, as well as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.Non-dairy probiotic productsDairy products are the main food carriers for probiotic bacteria to human. Limitations of these products such as the presence of allergens, high lactose and cholesterol contents, and the requirement for cold storage facilities have created the need to look for new probiotic product lines based on non-dairy substrates. Several ranges of non-dairy probiotic products have been developed and marketed in the last two decades.Chocolate– The application of probiotic bacteria into chocolate could offer a good alternative to common dairy products, and allow for broadening the health claims of chocolate-based food products. A chocolate mousse was developed by using probiotic and prebiotic ingredients withL. paracaseisubspecies and with the prebiotic ingredient inulin.Soy based products–  Soybeans are typically high in phytic acid, a plant compound that impairs the absorption of minerals like iron and zinc. Fermentation lowers the amount of phytic acid, which may increase the amount of minerals your body is able to absorb from tempeh and other products. It includes the following products:-Miso–  It is made by mixing soybeans with other ingredients, such as barley, rice and rye. Miso is a good source of protein, fiber and various vitamins, minerals and plant compounds, including vitamin K, manganese and copper.Natto– Natto is a fermented soy product that is a staple in Japanese kitchens. It contains a high amount of vitamin K2, which may help prevent osteoporosis and heart attacks.Tempeh– Tempeh serves as a popular, high-protein substitute for meat. It contains a decent amount of vitamin B12, a nutrient found mainly in animal products.Kombucha– It’s made by adding specific strains of bacteria, yeast and sugar to black or green tea, then allowing it to ferment for a week or more. Kombucha is rich in tea polyphenols and acetic acid, which have both been shown to suppress the growth of undesirable bacteria and yeasts as well as helped prevent the growth and spread of cancerous cells. In the market Kombucha is now available in several fruit flavours.Sourdough Bread– It is an old popular bread which has recently risen to popularity! A recent study showed the market value of sourdough increased from $298.7 million in 2014 to $2.4 billion in 2018. Sourdough bread may not seem that different from regular bread, however the fermentation process breaks down some of the gluten, and that makes it more digestible, especially for people who struggle to digest gluten. It helps to keep your gut bacteria happy, and may be less likely to spike blood sugar levels.",

Therefore, there’s no doubt that microbiologists are particularly valuable at the moment.  Especially virologists and those microbiologists that have an understanding of infectious diseases, public health and/or epidemiology.  Plus, some knowledge of immunology can be helpful to for vaccine development as can pharmacology for drug development.  However, it’s really the microbiologists that are coming to the fore.  People talk about ‘saving the world’ and about the impact and importance of careers, but microbiologists really can save the world.  If you had any doubt about the importance of a career in microbiology, then just consider what is happening in the world now and what has happened since December.  …and we’re not just talking about personal and public health, but livelihoods and the global economy.  The economy has gone ‘pear-shaped’ because of a microbiological phenomenon, something that could be stopped by microbiologists, if they are, or were given the opportunity.  The power is in the hands of microbiologists and those with an intricate understanding of microbiology, to save the world, I have no doubt about that.  So, if you want a powerful career, an impactful career, a highly significant career, then consider microbiology!A FOOD MICROBIOLOGY CAREERHow about a career in food microbiology?  What might that look like and what might one be involved with?  Well even in food microbiology there are many varied areas to work in.  The three key areas are: i) food safety, ii) food spoilage/food quality and iii) fermented foods, probiotics and gut health.  Each of these has highly significant impacts on society and on the economy.  Let’s look at each of these in more detail.What is food safety?Food safety is all about ensuring the safety of the food supply.  This means monitoring, auditing, regulating and developing policy for the purposes of safeguarding raw materials and manufactured food over the entire agrifood supply chain from ‘farm to fork’ or ‘paddock to plate’ as the concept goes.  Food safety microbiologists closely associate with epidemiologists, public health professionals and infectious disease experts to combat prevention, tracking and limiting the spread of foodborne diseases of epidemic proportions.What is food spoilage and food quality?Spoilage and subsequent wastage of food results in substantial economic losses.  In countries with developing economies, such spoilage and waste of food is more likely to be fresh produce and thus postharvest and pre-manufacure losses.  In countries with advanced economies, the situation is quite different, with substantial spoilage and waste taking place at the consumer level.  Tight supply chains along with excellent mechanisms of food preservation mean that spoilage losses in such countries are at a minimum.What are fermented foods, probiotics and gut health?This area is closely linked with personal health and wellness.  There is a sustained food trend in the area of probiotics as functional foods, along with prebiotics and people realise the great benefits of how one’s gut health contributes to overall health and wellbeing.  Related to this are fermented foods, many of which are probiotic, and as such, are rich natural sources of ‘good’ bacteria.CAREER PROFILE OF A FOOD MICROBIOLOGISTWondering how a career in food microbiology might actually look like in reality?  Well, I had a Q & A session with Lucy Lam, a food safety auditor from Taipei, Taiwan.  Let’s find out what Lucy’s food microbiology career looks like…What qualification(s) do you hold and from where?Master of Science, with a major in food, nutrition and technology, from The Chinese University of Hong KongBachelor of Food Science, from The University of MelbourneYour present position and where?Auditor, Bureau Veritas Certification  (Taiwan)How would you describe your career ‘in a nutshell’?A passion for food safety and quality control along with being good at problem solving. 1. Interest in manufacturing in any field, especially the food industry 2. Looking forward to opportunities to be involved more in food product development.Describe what you do you do on a day-to-day basis?As an auditor, I follow back office schedules to visit clients and conduct on-site audit. Before and after the audit, preparation of the report document is needed.How do you gain most satisfaction in your food microbiology career?When I gained the most hands-on experience in food microbiology when I was working in the food industry between 2013 – 2018. As I was a laboratory supervisor and department assistant manager, I had to oversee the operation of the laboratory including lab supplies, SOPs, good laboratory practices and third party laboratory compliances.What can you forsee as big challenges in your particular area of food microbiology?Food microbiology testing can be regarded as a quality control gate for product release and assurance in food industry. Hence the testing lead time will be demanding and tends to be “quick and accurate”. It is believed that rapid test kits or rapid test methods will be upcoming trends in food microbiology testing.Some advice about a career in food microbiology?It is suggested people who wish to be a food microbiologist must have basic food knowledge, and willing to do a lot of research and study.So there you have it, whether it’s building the health of individuals through improving gut health, ensuring public health is maintained through a safe food supply or curbing the substantial economic losses through food spoilage and food waste, there are multiple ways to save the world as a food microbiologist!

Fermented foods,"fermented-foods, food-quality",Food safety versus food quality … and expiry dates.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-safety-versus-food-quality-and-expiry-dates/,"January 19, 2020","Ok, well, a concept or maybe it’s just a definition, depending on how you look at it, that is of central importance, not only to food microbiology, but also to food science in general isfood safetyversusfood quality.  I say food science in general, because while to many, I believe, the (micro)biological aspects of food safety and food quality come to mind first, there are indeed many other facets to food safety and food quality.  It’s worth pointing out at this stage that food safety and food quality refers to the unintentional adulteration of food, as can be seen in the image above.  Food fraud and food defence are related concepts, but refer to intentional adulteration of food, of a criminal nature.Briefly then, to start with, what is food safety and what is food quality.  Food safety is a broad term in food science that certainly covers microbiological hazards first and foremost – bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoan and animal parasites, like helminth worms.  However, food safety includes non-biological hazards too (Figure 1).  These are either chemical hazards (for example; antibiotic residues, allergens, pesticide residues, residual cleaning chemicals) and physical hazards like glass, metal, wood and the like that might find their way into food and pose a hazard.  Then there is an interesting crossover area that is usually considered as a biological hazard, because of their biological origin, but it could also be though of as a chemical hazard – toxins produced by fungi or marine animals that find their way into food.Figure 1: An overview of potential hazards in food service operations ppt – Pizza &coFood quality, what is that?  What is quality food?  This is a pretty big question and one that has many perspectives, of which biological is just one.  In food microbiology, food quality is linked to the concept of food spoilage.  Spoiled food, commonly said to be “off”, is food that is no longer thought of as being fit, or maybe I should simply say “pleasant” for human consumption due to the proliferation of microbial growth that has altered the expected sensory expectations of that food.  Think mouldy bread (Figure 2), or ‘lumpy’ pasteurised milk (Figure 3) – these would be regarded as ‘off’, and are considered unpleasant to eat due to our expectation of what the microbiological quality, or status, of that product should be.  I’ll get on to this point again later, but there is a distinction between “fit” for consumption and “pleasant” for consumption.  Fit would be considered more of a food safety concept whereas pleasantness is more in the realm of food quality.  Now, apart from (micro)biological quality, there are concepts of food quality from other areas in food science.  For example nutritional quality and sensory quality.  Over time, during shelf-life, the nutritional status of a manufactured food product can change, and usually this refers to deterioration of nutritional quality because the nutrients present in the food may not match that stated in the Nutrient Information Panel, and furthermore, bioavailability could be impacted too.  Organoleptic, or sensory quality refers to what we can perceive of the product using our senses.  During storage and distribution of manufactured food, a range of quality issues can be impacted, resulting in a product that doesn’t meet with customers’ expectations for that product.  When this happens, the product can be seen by consumers to be of lower quality as it has deviated from not only their expectations, but what it was originally.  This can signal the end of shelf-life for that food.  This is one of the reasons food additives are used – to meet consumers’ quality expectations in that people expect a consistent product, from inconsistent raw biological materials with natural and normal biological variation.  Possibly an unrealistic expectation?  Either way, that’s life in countries considered to have advanced economies.Figure 2: Mould on bread (https://www.slideserve.com/tareq/bread-mold)Figure 3: Lumpy “off” milk (https://www.shared.com/sour-milk-healthier/)With the above information in mind, let us consider an important concept, a concept I consider one of the most important in the distinction between microbiological food safety and food quality.  I’m sure there are exceptions, but I’m not aware of them:Spoiled or “off” food does not make you ill.Foodborne disease originates from food that looks, tastes and smells perfectly normal and thus acceptable to the consumer.This leads me to a discussion of expiry dates, the two most common of which are “use by” and “best before” (Figure 4).  The Use By date is for food safety, and means that the manufacturer does not guarantee the safety of that food beyond that date, although it may (and almost certainly will) look, taste and smell unchanged from the original.  This is because the microorganisms that cause food borne disease are generally present in small amounts in a food and relatively few of them are required for us to get sick.  A Use By date tends to be used for perishable food products, meat and milk for example.  The Best Before date is for food quality, and means that the manufacturer does not guarantee the quality of that food beyond that date.  This means that, for example: the colour may have faded or become more intense; a crunchy product may have softened or a soft product may have become firm or crunchy; or chemical reactions may have taken place in the food which has lowered its nutritional quality.  Best before dates are commonly seen on non-perishable food products, like biscuits, cereals and nuts.Figure 4: The difference between Use By and Best Before dates … #eatitcookitfreezeitThe confusion that results Use By dates and Best Before dates is a key element in food wastage.  People sometimes discard a packet or biscuits that are past their Best Before date, for fear their consumption will make the ill.  These people are getting the Best Before date mixed up with the Use By date.  With few (if any) exceptions, a food beyond its Best Before date is still perfectly fine an acceptable to consume, but there is a (slim) chance it may be of lower quality compared to what you expect or what the product was immediately upon manufacture.  An example of the confusion that can result is shown in Figure 5.  Here we have a mouldy orange.  It is clearly spoiled, but cannot make you sick if you ate it.  Therefore, this flyer should have used “Best Before” rather than “Use By” because the quality of this fruit has deteriorated but it would still be safe to eat.Figure 5: This flyer should refer to the “Best Before” date rather than than the “Use By” date.Think about this: Perception of “off” or spoiled food is very much based on society norms or maybe even individual norms.  Take dairy yogurt, how did that originate?  Quite possibly like this … someone milked a cow, left the raw milk sitting around at 30°C or 40°C  for a day, then they tasted they lumpy and sour milk and thought that it was pretty nice.  This is a simplification of the more popular story of yogurt origin which says that ancient (about 5000 BC) herders from Central Asia stored milk in bags made of animal stomachs, which, after a period of time in the warm sun, ws enough to turn the liquid milk into semi-solid yogurt.   It might just be milk that has gone “off”, but maybe they bottled it, put the name “yogurt” on the outside and promoted it as a new fermented dairy product with a myriad of health benefits.  …and these fermented food products, my friends, are one of the hottest food trends of our time (Figure 6), even though the product and the concept probably originated as spoiled food in ancient times.  With that thought, I’ll leave it there.Figure 6: Fermented foods are the hottest trend in food.","best before, expiry date, food microbiology, Food safety, food science, use by"
Fermented foods,"fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",A natural way to get your dose of good bacteria.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/a-natural-way-to-get-your-dose-of-good-bacteria/,"December 22, 2019","On Sunday 20 October 2019, I had the opportunity to present this talk twice, at the 2nd annual VegoFest in Melbourne, a celebration of all things ‘vego’, organised by the Vegetarian and Cultural Association Incorporated.  What follows are the slides I used and (almost) a transcript of what I said.Slide 1 – G’day everyone, I’m Philip, an independent food microbiologist at my own start-up institute, Food Microbiology Academy.  Today I want to take you through what is one of the hottest topics in food microbiology at the moment, probiotics and gut health with this presentation titled “A natural way to get your dose of good bacteria”.Slide 2 – Before we actually get into the presentation proper, I want to give you a definition of “natural”, which will be relevant later on in the presentation, since the title of this talk refers to “natural”.  So in the food context, natural refers to a food “having had a minimum of processing or preservative treatment” – just keep this definition in the back of your mind as we progress through the talk.Slide 3 – Now, to start off with, I want to let you know, or remind you that microorganisms are indeed everywhere.  They have colonised every conceivable habitat and environmental niche on the planet – from really hot, to really cold, dark and high pressure environments.  Microorganisms are ubiquitous to the extent that if we can’t find them, then our current technology is probably not good enough to detect them!Slide 4 – Not only are they everywhere in an environmental context, but everywhere includes being on and in us too.  This image is to give you an indication that yes, microorganisms are living, growing and indeed thriving on and in our bodies, even in the harshest environments like the dry and salty skin and the highly acidic and low pH environment of the stomach.Slide 5 – This slide is to give you an indication of some of the so-called good guys and bad guys of the bacterial world, some of which you may have heard about.  Good bacteria include various species ofLactobacillus,Streptococcus thermophilusandBifidobacterium longum.Some of the Bacteria which always spell trouble areSalmonella typhi, most species ofStreptococcusapart fromStreptococcus thermophilusandHelicobacter pylori.Slide 6 – What we have here are some of the general benefits afforded by good gut Bacteria.  Starting at the top right – i) they produce various compounds which assist in digesting food, ii) some of them produce vitamins which are essential in human nutrition, iii) due to the location they reside and their numbers, they exert a protective effect on the epithelial lining of the gut, iv) modulation of the immune system is another important role they play in host non-specific defences and v) they employ various strategies to ward off pathogenic Bacteria, which we’ll cover off in the next slide.Slide 7 – Here we have various means employed by your resident gut Bacteria to resist colonisation by invading pathogenic Bacteria.  Firstly number one, on the left hand side is “Adhesion exclusion” – which means that the pathogens need to adhere to the cells lining the host’s gut in order to exert their disease potential.  However, due to competition for space and adhesion sites which the resident microbiome, the pathogens invariably miss out, and hence are excluded from gaining a ‘foothold’.  Numbers two and three refers to the fact that the pathogenic Bacteria, like all Bacteria and indeed all living organisms refer adequate nutrition.  Limitation on carbon sources, which are used for energy and micronutrients, by the good Bacteria essentially starve the invading Bacteria of the nutrients they need to thrive, grow and even survive.  If this isn’t enough, your resident good Bacteria produce antimicrobial substances and toxins which directly attack ad destroy the ‘bad guys’.  While your gut microbiota is employing all these strategies to ward off the invaders and prevent disease, the pathogens have a host of virulence factors they are expressing to combat everything ‘being thrown at them’.  Basically, there’s a ‘war’ going on in your gut, the good Bacteria of your gut versus the invading pathogenic Bacteria.  If the ‘good guys’ win, you stay healthy, but if the ‘bad guys’ win, then you get sick – it’s as simple as that!Slide 8 – So, we know probiotic Bacteria are good and we need to look after and replenish our gut microbiome, but how?  Well, there’s basically two ways – probiotic supplements, so tablets or pills containing probiotics or the alternative, the more natural way, is to consume fermented foods containing probiotics, such as these yum fermented vegetables.  Something to remember – not all fermented foods contain probiotics and not all fermented foods that are meant to contain probiotics, actually do.  For example, if sauerkraut has been heat treated after fermentation, then the probiotic Bacteria are going to be all but killed off.  Thus, the best option is actually to make your own fermented foods.Slide 9 – Here we have a range of fermented foods displayed, but like we said in the previous slide, not all of them are actually probiotic foods.  Tempeh, kombucha and soy sauce are fermented foods, but do not contain probiotics – even chocolate manufacture includes a fermentation step, but is not considered a probiotic food.  Sauerkraut, kimchi and natto are fantastic vegan probiotic fermented foods while kefir is an excellent probiotic dairy drink.Slide 10 – In this slide I want to concentrate on two fermented cabbage products, Korean kimchi and German sauerkraut.  Both are amongst the healthiest fermented probiotic foods to include in your diet.  They can certainly be considered a physiologically functional food due to all these added benefits they offer – both promote immune system function while interestingly, probiotic lactobacilli starter cultures from kimchi have demonstrated anti-obesity effects when used as a dietary supplement.Slide 11 – So, to sum up – if you take antibiotics, lead a stressful lifestyle, including getting insufficient sleep and are careless with food safety, then you are supporting and encouraging the growth of pathogenic Bacteria.  On the other hand, if you include fermented foods or probiotic supplements in your diet and your diet is healthy, which means, based on fruit and vegetables, then you are providing the best conditions for growth or ‘friendly Bacteria.I’ve included a list below of some books on Amazon related to this topic:Fermented VegetablesRaw Vegan Cuisine & Fermented Foods: Gourmet & Cultured Living Raw Food Recipes.

Food,food,An external review of our book,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/an-external-review-of-our-book/,"October 7, 2020","Food product development is central to food science.  Development of new food products is essential to food manufacturers and an area that can be a raging success or a dismal failure.  Of course the word “failure” is filled with negative connotations and it is better to seek of “lessons learnt” or “understanding gained”.  This is so true, because with a product that is not popular with consumers, you really know what the market dislikes, which is so important.  In addition, with such a high failure rate of new food products, the process needs to be approached and undertaken in a systematic manner in order to maximise chances of success.  That’s where this book comes – it’s meant to be a handy reference guide to the process of food product development for home entrepreneurs.  These are people that have an idea or a concept for a food product they want to commercialise but don’t know where to start.  Thus, it is designed for non-scientists and for people starting out on their journey of bringing a product to market.In this first edition, DrPhilip Buttonwas the in-house author, who teamed up with DrYakindra Timilsenafrom theFood and Nutrition Consulting Group.Dr Button contributed the section on the principles of food product development while Dr Timilsena contributed the section on the practice of food product development.Drs Yakindra Timilsena (left) & Philip Button (right)Our book can be purchasedherewhere you can also find details of the chapter contents.We were fortunate to secure a peer-reviewer for our book in MsPilar Oyarzun,a senior food technologist.  Here are her thoughts:I must say the book is a pretty good idea and tool, most of my clients are in the home cook stage and are looking to do their product commercially, but lack knowledge about the journey.In terms of content I think is good, but probably will overwhelm readers seeking help in early stages when they are seeking some answers as well as guidance, so it brings content but, it is also practical.Here are some thoughts to help out with that:1. Involving an expert: Advising where, who and which are the options when seeking an expert to help with PD.2. More diagrams: I think people will like to see more decision-making maps or flow charts, to understand the steps involved.3. Appendix with Food Science and Technology basic terminology. For example, the formulation is a recipe. I have come across people that think that Nutritional Information and Ingredient list are the same info.4. Market Research:  I advise people that are not very clear with what they want to do, is to take information from the product in the market and check the information in the label (ingredient list, certifications, package, portions ), to understand what they want in relation to what is out there.5. Standardization of product and process: Many clients struggle with this part, they do not understand the importance of standardized ingredients, suppliers and mainly the process to seek a continuous level of quality.6. Health claims: Many clients think their product has more benefits in terms of health and that is why it will be successful, but the reality is that they have to claim what they can prove and follow the law.  Digging a bit more on this will help people.7. Useful Links: a more diverse list at the end to support further knowledge. Maybe add mentoring programs from the government, more free resources for entrepreneurs and more Legislation websites. (some people are making dangerous decisions) they need to know they have to follow the rules and where to seek help.8. Product Development Planning template: Having a questionnaire template to go through every stage that you have mentioned to plan a Product development project, will help them practically. They can use what they just read and put what they have in mind into paper, and feel less overwhelmed about the new information.In addition to Ms Oyarzun’s comments, it has been suggested that the inclusion of case studies would be of much value to readers.  These would enable them to see and understand first-hand the success stories from others.The second edition is in progress, so watch this space!Let us finish off with this thought…You know how 70 to 90% of newly developed food products fail within a year of retail release?  Well, we teach home-based food entrepreneurs and food manufacturing start-ups how to develop food products that succeed in the long term by creating an intricate food product development strategy.","book review, food product development, food science"
Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality, fungi, yeast",From HPP Innovation Week – Part 2,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/from-hpp-innovation-week-part-2/,"July 5, 2024","This is the second of a two-part series of overview blog articles written byChloe Lam(chloe.lam@foodmicrobiology.academy), who attended the HPP Innovation Week session from 18-20 June 2024.Food safety controlRegarding risk analysis for ensuring food safety in food production, HPP has a role in controlling biological hazards (i.e. pathogens). By modifying HPP parameters including pressure, holding time, and water temperature, HPP can be integrated into HACCP plans as the critical control point. According to @Mario González, Ph.d. | HPP Applications Manager at Hiperbaric, HPP even has the potential to reduce the allergenicity of certain foods and reduce the concentration of mycotoxin.HPP can be used to facilitate hazard control in food products. It can be used in controlling the pathogenic microbial concentration. In terms of bacterial inactivation, HPP helps meeting the performance criterion of > 3log reduction of bacteria level established by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference. The limitation of spoilage microorganisms can minimize the formation of TMA, which lowers the risk of food poisoning. Besides, the HPP technique can facilitate the elimination of parasites. Mild HPP conditions for around 180 seconds can completely inactivate parasites from raw fish fillets. The use of mild HPP conditions not only can eliminate parasites, but also minimize the impact on quality.HPP is a versatile nonthermal food preservation technique that inactive pathogens while maintaining sensory and nutritional qualities. The implementation of HPP allows for avoiding product recalls and market withdrawals associated with biological hazards.Application in various productsMultiple researches have been conducted on various food products, including craft beer, cold brew coffee, durian, and seafood. All showed an extended reduction of spoilage bacteria levels after HPP. Unlike thermal pasteurization, HPP maintains the stability of products and does not change the quality profile of food.Taking craft beer as an illustrative example, HPP has a growing market in this field, driven by the increasing popularity and demand.  This technology can extend the shelf-life of products without the need for heating or the addition of preservatives. Even though pasteurization can effectively prevent microbial growth, it would also induce unfavorable alterations such as accelerated aging and developing a stale flavor. Notably, a significant reduction of spoilage bacteria (3.1log) is maintained throughout the product’s shelf-life (@Rui Queirós, Ph.d. | HPP Applications Specialist at Hiperbaric).On the flip side, HPP also proves highly advantageous in preserving the quality of craft beer. It can retain the quality of craft beer without altering sensory attributes, color, and alcohol content. Customers are unable to distinguish HPP-treated beer from untreated samples in sensory tests, indicating the process preserves the intended flavor profile. This highlights HPP’s suitability for maintaining the authentic taste and sensory characteristics of products, avoiding the quality degradation that can occur with heat-based treatments.Overall, the versatility of HPP technology is illustrated where it can extend shelf-life and preserve the inherent sensory qualities that consumers demand, without compromising the integrity of the final product.SummaryHigh Pressure Processing (HPP) is an innovative nonthermal food preservation technology that is transforming the food industry. By using high hydrostatic pressure, HPP can inactivate harmful microorganisms and extend the shelf-life of a wide range of food products, from meat and seafood to beverages and dips, while preserving their natural flavors, nutrients, and appearance. Compared to traditional thermal pasteurisation, HPP offers significant advantages, including the ability to create “clean label” foods with minimal additives, improve visual appeal, and facilitate more efficient and higher-yielding extraction of shellfish meat. With a rapidly growing global market, HPP is well-positioned to address consumer demand for minimally processed, safe, and high-quality foods.","food industry, food manufacturing, food microbiology, food preservation, food processing, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease"
Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality",From HPP Innovation week – Part 1,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/from-hpp-innovation-week-part-1/,"June 30, 2024","Hiperbaric îs a global leader in commercial high pressure processing (HPP) technology and innovation.  From June 18 to 20, they ran HPP Innovation Week, an event to promote innovation with this, the longest and most widely established non-thermal food processing technology in commercial use.In attendance and representing Food Microbiology Academy wasChloe Lam.  Chloe is a 3rd-year biomedical science student at Monash University who is currently undertaking a period of industry placement with us.  Over this and the next blog article, is Chloe’s report on her attendance at the event.  Until 19 July 2024, Chloe can be contacted atchloe.lam@foodmicrobiology.academy.High Pressure Processing (HPP) is a nonthermal food preservation technology that uses hydrostatic pressure to inactivate microorganisms to achieve post-packaging preservation. The pre-packaged food product would be loaded into a basket in a vessel with low-pressure water. To instantly create a high pressure, intensifiers pump high-pressure water into the vessel. Food products would be held in the chamber to eliminate pathogens.BenefitsThis process can inactivate microbes from food, facilitating the creation of clean-label foods with minimal additives, while extending shelf-life and enabling access to long-distance markets. Compared to traditional pasteurisation, HPP has minimal effect on the composition, nutrition level, and the flavor of food. The technology is highly versatile, which is applicable across a wide range of food products including ready-to-eat meals, drinks, dips and sauces, baby food, and pet food.One advantage of HPP over traditional pasteurization is its ability to improve the visual appearance of some food. Nonthermal HPP technology can retain or even enhance food appearance. This is well illustrated in avocado products. High pressure can inactivate the enzyme polyphenol oxidase PPO and prevent the browning of avocados. This, in turn, improves the overall appearance of guacamole and other avocado-based products over long-term storage. Beyond avocado, HPP can also positively impact the visual appearance of raw steak. Treated by HPP, raw steak redness is enhanced without affecting the eating qualities of cooked dark-cutting beef steaks. Steaks exhibit bright red color and have a lower level of reactive substance values, resulting in a more desirable visual presentation.Another key benefit of HPP is its application in shucking – the extraction of meat from shellfish. HPP processes shucking at a faster rate and a lower yield loss.In the case of oysters, HPP is highly recommended as a preservation treatment for several reasons. Firstly, HPP ensures food safety by controlling microorganism levels and extending the shelf life in selling conditions. Secondly, the high pressure of HPP loosens the muscle attached to the shell, allowing effortless extraction of crustacean meat without the use of heat, achieving a significant yield increase from 20-50% more than conventional methods and greatly reducing hand labor.  Moreover, as HPP is carried out in a water-filled chamber, it can hydrate and moisturize oysters, leading to a more appealing appearance. A live shellfish would be preferred to preserve the quality and freshness of seafood. Interestingly, subjecting live shellfish to HPP may even lessen animal suffering, as noted by @Daniela Soto Castro. The shucking application of HPP can also be utilised for extracting fruit, such as durian, which is a more common practice in Asian countries. Overall, the advantages of HPP for shucking include improved efficiency, higher yields, reduced labor, and potential animal welfare benefits, making it a highly valuable technology for the shellfish and seafood industries.Global PotentialHPP has a huge potential in the global market. Spain, US, China, and South Korea are major HPP markets. HPP are primarily used for preserving meat, guacamole, juices and ready-to-eat meals in these markets. An increasing trend of HPP systems is reported with a 15.68% growth of the HPP market from 2022 to 2023. The growth matches the current sustainable food trend of having less processed food with a healthier and cleaner label with minimal additives.Besides, HPP automation can increase productivity in the industry. Food preserving would be more effective. HPP has a typical holding time of 3 minutes which can significantly diminish the level of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. Food preservation would be easier with the HPP.","food manufacturing, food microbiology, food processing, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease"

Food quality,"fermented-foods, food-quality, probiotics-and-gut-health",A journey through the history of food microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/a-journey-through-the-history-of-food-microbiology/,"October 24, 2023","The world of food is not merely a feast for the senses; it is a realm teeming with invisible life. The study of food microbiology, a fascinating and indispensable branch of science, has revealed the hidden microcosm that plays a pivotal role in the production, preservation, and safety of the food we consume. As we delve into the annals of history, we’ll unearth the remarkable journey of food microbiology, from its nascent beginnings to its crucial role in contemporary food science and safety.The dawn of microbiologyThe story of food microbiology commences in the early 17th century when the Dutch merchant and amateur scientist, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, crafted simple microscopes and laid the groundwork for microbiology as a whole. Using these rudimentary devices, Leeuwenhoek examined various biological samples, including water and tiny flecks of food. In 1676, he became the first person to witness bacteria through a microscope, marking the dawn of microbiology.Spontaneous generation and fermentationIn the centuries that followed, the relationship between microorganisms and food remained largely uncharted territory. The prevailing belief was in spontaneous generation, the idea that life could arise spontaneously from non-living matter. For example, it was widely believed that food spoilage was a result of spontaneous generation rather than the activity of microorganisms.It was not until the 18th century that scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani conducted groundbreaking experiments to refute the theory of spontaneous generation. His meticulous work with food preservation, particularly the sealing of broth in sterile containers, demonstrated that food spoilage could be prevented by preventing the entry of microorganisms.Another pivotal figure in the history of food microbiology is Louis Pasteur, who conducted extensive research on the fermentation processes used in food and beverage production. In the mid-19th century, Pasteur demonstrated that microorganisms were responsible for fermentation in products like wine, beer, and bread. His work laid the foundation for the controlled fermentation processes we use in the food industry today.The birth of modern food microbiologyThe late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a surge in scientific understanding of food microbiology. This period witnessed the identification of specific microorganisms responsible for foodborne illnesses and the development of technologies to combat foodborne pathogens.One pivotal discovery came in the late 19th century when Robert Koch, a pioneering figure in medical microbiology, isolated the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis. This marked a significant step in the identification of pathogenic microorganisms in food. Soon after, scientists identified bacteria such asSalmonellaandEscherichia coli(E. coli) as the culprits behind foodborne illnesses, leading to the development of the first food safety regulations and guidelines.The advent of food preservation methodsWith the understanding of microorganisms’ role in food spoilage and foodborne illnesses, researchers began to develop food preservation methods that harnessed this knowledge. One such method, pasteurisation, was named after Louis Pasteur. It involved heating food products to specific temperatures for a set duration to kill harmful microorganisms while preserving the food’s quality. Pasteurization remains a crucial food processing method, used for dairy products, juices, and various beverages.The 19th century also saw the development of canning, a method that involved sealing food in airtight containers to prevent microbial contamination. This method, pioneered by Nicolas Appert and later perfected by Louis Pasteur, revolutionized food preservation and contributed to the global expansion of food industries.The era of microbiological standards and regulationsAs the food industry grew, so did concerns about food safety. The need for standardized procedures and regulations to ensure the microbiological safety of food became apparent. In the early 20th century, the United States established the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, marking one of the earliest efforts to regulate food safety. This act laid the foundation for the creation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1930.Around the same time, microbiological standards were developed, setting limits on the permissible levels of certain microorganisms in food products. These standards helped ensure the safety of food by regulating the number of harmful microorganisms allowed in products.The discovery of antibiotics and food microbiologyThe discovery of antibiotics in the mid-20th century had a significant impact on food microbiology. Antibiotics like penicillin and tetracycline were not only used to treat human infections but also found applications in agriculture and food production. They were used to control bacterial contaminants and diseases in livestock, contributing to increased food safety.However, the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture has raised concerns about antibiotic resistance in foodborne pathogens. This issue continues to be a subject of study and regulatory efforts in contemporary food microbiology.Modern food microbiologyThe late 20th century and early 21st century have witnessed a proliferation of advanced techniques and tools in food microbiology. Molecular biology, genomics, and bioinformatics have provided scientists with unprecedented insights into the microbial communities present in food and their impact on safety and quality.Techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing have enabled the rapid and accurate detection and identification of microorganisms in food. This has been invaluable for tracking outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, investigating contamination sources, and ensuring the safety of food products.The field of food microbiology has also expanded its scope to include the study of probiotics, prebiotics, and the human microbiome. Probiotics are beneficial microorganisms that can improve gut health and overall well-being when consumed in certain food products. Prebiotics, on the other hand, are non-digestible compounds that support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.Challenges and future directionsAs our understanding of food microbiology continues to grow, so do the challenges we face. The globalization of food production and distribution has made it increasingly difficult to monitor and control foodborne pathogens. Emerging pathogens and antimicrobial resistance are ongoing concerns that require constant vigilance and research.Additionally, the demand for more sustainable and environmentally friendly food production practices is driving innovation in food microbiology. The development of alternative protein sources, such as plant-based and cell-cultured meats, presents new challenges and opportunities in terms of microbial safety and quality control.ConclusionThe history of food microbiology is a testament to the ever-evolving relationship between science and our culinary world. From the humble observations of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek to the advanced molecular techniques of today, food microbiology has uncovered the invisible forces that shape the safety and quality of our food.As we move forward, the challenges of a globalised food supply chain, emerging pathogens, and the quest for sustainable food production will continue to shape the field. With the lessons of the past as our guide, food microbiology will play a critical role in ensuring that our meals are not only delicious but also safe and sustainable for generations to come.","food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology, probiotics"

Food quality,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, food-quality, fungi, viruses, yeast",50 facts about food microbiology!,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/50-facts-about-food-microbiology/,"June 26, 2023","Food microbiology is the study of microorganisms that interact with food, including bacteria, viruses, yeasts, molds, and parasites.Microorganisms can be both beneficial and harmful to food. Beneficial microorganisms are used in processes like fermentation and production of certain foods, while harmful microorganisms can cause foodborne illnesses.Bacteria are the most common microorganisms associated with food spoilage and foodborne diseases.Some common bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses includeSalmonella,Escherichiacoli(E. coli),Listeriamonocytogenes, andCampylobacter.Viruses, such as Norovirus and Hepatitis A, can also contaminate food and cause foodborne illnesses.Yeasts and molds are responsible for food spoilage and can affect the texture, flavor, and appearance of food.Microorganisms can contaminate food at various stages, including during production, processing, transportation, and storage.Foodborne illnesses can result from consuming contaminated raw or undercooked food, improper food handling and preparation, cross-contamination, and inadequate storage temperatures.Temperature control is crucial in preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms. The temperature danger zone for food is between 4 °C (40 °F) and 60 °C (140°F).Pasteurisation is a process that involves heating food to a specific temperature to kill or inactivate harmful microorganisms, while retaining the food’s quality.Fermentation is a process that uses beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, to convert sugars into alcohol or acids. Examples include yogurt, cheese, sauerkraut, and pickles.Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, provide health benefits. They are often found in fermented foods and are known to promote gut health.Food preservation techniques, such as canning, drying, and freezing, aim to prevent or slow down the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.Good hygiene practices, including proper handwashing, cleaning and sanitizing of surfaces, and maintaining personal hygiene, are essential in preventing the spread of microorganisms in food.Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a systematic approach used in the food industry to identify and control potential hazards related to food safety.Foodborne illnesses can have various symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and in severe cases, organ failure or death.Proper cooking temperatures are critical to ensure the elimination of harmful microorganisms. For example, poultry should reach an internal temperature of 74 °C (165 °F), while ground meat should reach 71 °C (160 °F).Cross-contamination can occur when raw foods come into contact with cooked or ready-to-eat foods, potentially transferring harmful microorganisms. Separate cutting boards and utensils should be used for raw and ready-to-eat foods.Some food products undergo a process called aseptic packaging, which involves sterilizing the food and packaging materials separately and then filling the sterile food into sterile containers.The pH level of a food product can influence the growth of microorganisms. Most bacteria prefer a neutral pH around 7, while some acid-tolerant bacteria can grow in low-pH environments.Food poisoning is a type of foodborne illness caused by the ingestion of toxins produced by certain bacteria, such asStaphylococcusaureusandBacilluscereus.Food intoxication occurs when the ingestion of food contaminated with live microorganisms leads to illness. Examples includeSalmonellaandCampylobacterinfections.Food allergies are immune responses triggered by specific proteins in food. They are not caused by microorganisms but can be influenced by cross-contamination or improper labeling.Botulism is a severe form of food poisoning caused by the toxin produced by the bacteriumClostridiumbotulinum. It can result from improperly canned or preserved foods.Fermented dairy products, such as yogurt and kefir, contain beneficial bacteria known as probiotics, which can contribute to a healthy gut microbiome.The use of antibiotics in livestock can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can potentially be transmitted to humans through contaminated food.The development of rapid diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing, has revolutionised the detection and identification of microorganisms in food.Food microbiologists often work closely with food scientists, food safety experts, and regulatory agencies to ensure the safety and quality of food products.Food recalls can occur when a product is found to be contaminated with harmful microorganisms or other hazards. They are initiated to protect public health.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, are used in the production of alcoholic beverages through the process of fermentation.Foodborne pathogens can survive and multiply in refrigerated environments, emphasising the importance of proper storage temperatures and practices.Cross-protective adaptations can occur between different microorganisms in food, where the presence of one microorganism inhibits the growth of another.Food fermentation can enhance the nutritional value of foods by increasing the availability of certain vitamins and minerals.Some moulds produce mycotoxins, which are toxic compounds that can contaminate food. Examples include aflatoxins, produced byAspergillusmolds, which can be found in nuts, grains, and spices.Biopreservation is a technique that uses naturally occurring microorganisms or their products to inhibit the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in food.The microbial composition of food can vary depending on factors such as the source of the food, processing methods, and storage conditions.Some beneficial bacteria, such as those in the genusLactobacillusandBifidobacterium, are commonly used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products.Foodborne illness outbreaks can occur when multiple people experience similar symptoms after consuming contaminated food from a common source.Food safety regulations and guidelines differ among countries and are often based on risk assessments and scientific evidence.The use of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) is being explored as a potential alternative to antibiotics for controlling bacterial pathogens in food.Some microorganisms, such as those in the genusSaccharomyces, are used in bread making and contribute to the fermentation process, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and alcohol.High-pressure processing (HPP) is a non-thermal food preservation technique that uses high pressure to inactivate microorganisms while retaining the nutritional value and quality of food.Microorganisms can form biofilms on food contact surfaces, making them more resistant to cleaning and sanitising agents.The presence of certain microorganisms, such asPseudomonasspp., can accelerate the spoilage of fresh produce.Foodborne illnesses can have significant economic impacts, including medical costs, loss of productivity, and damage to the reputation of food manufacturers.The study of foodborne pathogens and their transmission routes is essential for developing effective control strategies to prevent foodborne illnesses.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, can produce enzymes that enhance the flavor and texture of food products.Food safety training and education are vital for food handlers and consumers to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure proper food handling practices.Microbial testing is commonly used in the food industry to monitor the quality and safety of food products.Ongoing research in food microbiology aims to develop novel methods for microbial control, improve food preservation techniques, and enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and food.","food microbiologist, food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality",Philip Button’s MSc thesis and PhD thesis,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/philip-buttons-msc-thesis-and-phd-thesis/,"May 14, 2023","Please find below, Dr Philip Button’s two postgraduate research degree theses.  Not sure if this constitutes a blog article or more of a webpage, but it nevertheless documents a full-time research journey in bacterial physiology from June 2000 until August 2007, first at La Trobe University, then at The University of Melbourne.Dr Button commenced his PhD studies in the School of Agriculture and Food Systems at The University of Melbourne on 1 July 2002 and submitted his thesis for examination on 24 August 2007.  He graduated PhD on 5 April 2008 in Wilson Hall, on the University’s Parkville campus.  His topic of investigation was on spoilage of UHT milk due to residual activity from thermostable proteases and lipases originating from raw milk psychotropicPseudomonasspecies, such asP. fluorescens.Dr Button published one peer-reviewed original research paper from his PhD thesis, in theJournal of Food Quality, and a peer-reviewed book chapter.Spoilage of UHT milk is of concern to the Australian dairy industry.  Bacterial lipases and proteases have been identified as a key cause of spoilage of long life dairy products. They are synthesised in raw milk by psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. during refrigerated storage and persist as active enzymes in dairy products owing to retention of activity after heat treatment. The continuing action of lipase and protease may cause spoilage of all long life dairy products, including UHT milk, butter and cheese.The aims of this PhD project were to: I) optimise assays for lipase and protease produced by psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. and identify those which are more sensitive than those currently available, II) correlate the progress of lipolysis and proteolysis in these assays with the accumulation of products of lipolysis and proteolysis in UHT milk during storage, and relate it to common organoleptic defects in UHT milk, and, III) identify sources of psychrotrophic Pseudomonas spp. in raw milk and the industry practices likely to contribute to the presence of lipases and proteases from psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. in UHT milk.The present study identified lipase and protease assays which could be used to detect limited lipolysis and proteolysis in UHT milk that may result in organoleptic defects during shelf life. These assays utilised the milk-like substrate triolein for lipase detection and the labelled substrate FITC-casein for protease detection. In these assays, a strong correlation was observed between the extent of hydrolysis of the substrate in the assay and the progress of lipolysis and proteolysis in milk. Furthermore, these assays could be used to detect levels of lipolysis or proteolysis that are likely to result in spoilage in UHT milk after three to five months of storage.The progress of some biochemical changes in UHT milk have been followed during shelf life. The shelf life of the milk sample was limited by the development of age gelation, which occurred after viscosity increased to 120-150 mPas, although there were no appreciable off-aromas or off-flavours at this time. Age gelation was accompanied by a large decline in the kappa-casein content, particularly in the days immediately prior to its development. At no time were off-aromas or off-flavours reported. This is consistent with the absence of measurable quantities of hydrophobic peptides and free fatty acids which contribute to flavour, in the samples.PsychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. were isolated from farm, tanker and silo milk. A total of 39 PFGE Types were identified among 45 isolates which demonstrated considerable genetic diversity inPseudomonasspp. in raw milk.  Isolates from one of the farms and from the silo had the greatest potential for causing spoilage. This is because proportions of the strongly lipolytic and proteolytic isolates were higher and they grew to spoilage levels more quickly than isolates from other sources. Although incubation of the milk at 10 ºC led to fasterPseudomonasspp. growth, this growth temperature resulted in the proliferation of bacteria that were less lipolytic and proteolytic than did incubation at 4 ºC. After growing at 4 ºC, thePseudomonasspp. were also more lipolytic and proteolytic than the bacteria present in the unincubated milk.Specificity of a typical psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. protease, protease B52 fromPseudomonasfluorescensB52, towards as- and b-casein was investigated. Mass spectral analysis revealed limited specificity, with the peptides released being mostly hydrophilic. This result suggests that B52 protease is unlikely to cause bitterness from degradation of as- and b-casein.The present study has improved our basic understanding of psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. lipase and protease action in UHT milk. In addition, information has been provided to industry regarding improved detection methods along with sources and practices that may contribute to increased lipase and protease contamination of UHT milk and other long-life dairy products.phd-thesis-philip-button-the-university-of-melbourneDownloadFor his MSc, a 100% research degree in the Department of Agricultural Sciences at La Trobe University,  Dr Button undertook some voluntary pre-reading and a review of the literature in May and June of 2000, before enrolling into an MSc in July of that year.  He submitted his thesis in March 2002 and graduated on 28 March 2003.  Characterisation of extracellular high-affinity iron binding proteins secreted by pork spoilage psychotrophicPseudomonasspecies, in particularP. putida, was the topic of his research.Food spoilage results in major economic losses in the domestic and export markets as well as in the home. In addition, the possibility of gastrointestinal concerns arise, if the food contains an extreme number of organisms. Refrigerated, aerobically stored meat is spoiled predominantly by psychrotrophicPseudomonasspecies. These includeP. fragi, P. fluorescens and P. putida.  Previous work in this laboratory identified psychrotrophic pseudomonads as the major spoilage organisms of pork, stored aerobically at chill temperatures.  Furthermore, siderophores were identified in this study as a major component of the ability of these organisms to grow under conditions of iron-deficiency and partial characterisation of a potentially novel siderophore-mediated iron acquisition system was carried out. This present work provided further insights into the biological nature of this system, through the use of bioassays. Bioassays for detection of theE. colisiderophores aerobactin and enterochelin were used as a base on which to develop a new bioasay detection system for this potentially novel pseudomoand siderophore. Responses were investigated to various iron sources as well as supernatants containing siderophore, of varying levels of purification. In order to completely characterise the biological and genetic basis of this system, new mutants were sought by transposon mutagensis which were defective in siderophore biosynthesis. These were to be used for determination of the biosynthetic pathway, characterisation of the genes involved, a new diagnostic bioassay and ultimately, a vaccine. A separate section of work studied a number of hydroxamate producingE. colistrains, of diverse sources. These strains were part of a previous investigation in this laboratory. The aerobactin bioassay, refined during the course of this project, was utilised in screening of these strains. Previously, these strains (of diverse origin) were identified as producers of a hydroxamate of unknown type. All isolates that were hyroxamate positive, were aerobactin positive.msc-thesis-philip-buttonDownload","food microbiologist, food microbiology, food preservation, food science, food spoilage, microbiology"
Food quality,"food-quality, uncategorized",Blockchain or bust: A business and science revolution for food microbiology?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/blockchain-or-bust-a-business-and-science-revolution-for-food-microbiology/,"May 3, 2023","Blockchain technology has become a buzzword in recent years, but its origins can be traced back to the early days of the internet. The first blockchain-like concept was introduced in 1991 by two researchers, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, who proposed a way to create a tamper-proof digital document by using cryptographic techniques. However, it was not until 2008 that the first practical application of blockchain technology was introduced.In 2008, an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” This white paper proposed a decentralised digital currency that could be transferred between individuals without the need for intermediaries like banks. The underlying technology used to facilitate these transactions was called blockchain.The first blockchain was created in 2009 to power the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The blockchain served as a distributed ledger, recording every transaction that took place on the network. The ledger was stored on a network of computers, and each computer had a copy of the ledger, making it impossible for any single entity to alter the record.The early years of blockchain technology were largely dominated by the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin was the first and most well-known blockchain-based cryptocurrency, but over time, many other cryptocurrencies were created using blockchain technology, including Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.However, as the technology evolved, people began to realise that blockchain had applications beyond the cryptocurrency industry. Blockchain technology could be used to create secure, decentralised systems for a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, supply chain management, and more.Today, blockchain technology is being explored by companies and organisations around the world. It is still a relatively new technology, and many of its potential applications are still being discovered.

Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality, yeast",Spoilage of high acid fruit-based beverages,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/spoilage-of-high-acid-fruit-based-beverages/,"April 10, 2023","Introduction to food spoilage bacteria and their role in food deteriorationFood spoilage bacteria are microorganisms that cause undesirable changes in food, resulting in a decline in quality, texture, flavor, and color. These bacteria are ubiquitous, meaning they are present everywhere in the environment. They can enter the food chain through raw materials, processing, handling, and storage. When food spoilage bacteria grow and multiply in food, they produce various enzymes, acids, and other metabolites that lead to spoilage.Understanding the different types of food spoilage bacteriaThere are many types of food spoilage bacteria, but the ones that are most commonly associated with juice spoilage are thermophilic, thermoduric, and spore-forming bacteria.Thermophilic bacteria thrive in high-temperature environments and can survive pasteurisation. They cause spoilage in heat-processed beverages such as juice by producing heat-resistant enzymes that break down the carbohydrates and proteins present in the juice.Thermoduric bacteria can survive pasteurisation but do not grow at high temperatures. They can enter the processing plant through raw materials, equipment, and personnel. They cause spoilage by producing off-flavors and odors in the juice.Spore-forming bacteria are heat-resistant and can survive high-temperature processing. They can form dormant spores that can resist heat, drying, and other adverse conditions. When the conditions become favorable, the spores germinate and grow, causing spoilage in the juice.The impact of food spoilage bacteria on juice productsFood spoilage bacteria can cause various types of spoilage in juice products, such as:Cloudiness caused by bacterial growth and sedimentationOff-flavors and odors caused by the breakdown of organic compoundsGas production caused by bacterial fermentationColor changes caused by the breakdown of pigmentsThese changes can lead to a decline in quality, texture, and flavor of the juice, making it unsuitable for consumption.Factors that influence the growth and development of food spoilage bacteria in juiceSeveral factors can affect the growth and development of food spoilage bacteria in juice products, such as:pH: Most spoilage bacteria prefer a slightly acidic pH range, between 4.5 and 7.0.Water Activity: The availability of water in the juice can affect the growth of spoilage bacteria. The higher the water activity, the more favorable the conditions for bacterial growth.Nutrients: The presence of nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, and vitamins can support bacterial growth.Oxygen: The presence or absence of oxygen can influence the type of bacteria that grow in the juice.Temperature: The temperature at which the juice is stored can affect the growth rate of bacteria.The role of thermophilic and thermoduric bacteria in juice spoilageThermophilic and thermoduric bacteria are the most common types of spoilage bacteria in heat-processed beverages such as juice. They can survive pasteurization and grow at high temperatures, causing spoilage in the juice.Thermophilic bacteria such asBacillus,Geobacillus, andAlicyclobacillusare known for producing heat-resistant enzymes that can break down the carbohydrates and proteins present in the juice. They can cause cloudiness, off-flavors, and odors in the juice.Thermoduric bacteria such asBacillus,PseudomonasandMicrococcuscan survive pasteurisation but do not grow at high temperatures. They can cause off-flavors and odors in the juice, making it unsuitable for consumption.The role of spore-forming bacteria in juice spoilageSpore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus, Clostridium, and Sporolactobacillus are heat-resistant and can survive high-temperature processing. They can form dormant spores that can resist heat, drying, and other adverse conditions. When the conditions become favorable, the spores germinate and grow, causing spoilage in the juice.The impact of heat processing on the growth of spoilage bacteria in juiceHeat processing can kill most bacteria present in the juice. However, it cannot eliminate spores or thermophilic bacteria that can survive pasteurization. The presence of these bacteria in the juice can result in spoilage.A closer look at the most common spoilage bacteria in heat-processed beverages –Bacillus,AlicyclobacillusandGeobacillusBacillus,AlicyclobacillusandGeobacillusare the most common types of spoilage bacteria found in heat-processed beverages such as juice.Bacillus– spore-forming bacteria that can survive high-temperature processing. It can cause spoilage by producing off-flavors, odors, and cloudiness in the juice.Alicyclobacillus– thermophilic bacteria that can survive pasteurisation. It produces guaiacol, a compound that gives a smoky or burnt taste to the juice.Geobacillus– thermophilic bacteria that can survive pasteurisation. It can cause spoilage by producing off-flavors and odors in the juice.How to prevent the spoilage of heat-processed beveragesPreventing the spoilage of heat-processed beverages such as juice requires a combination of good manufacturing practices and proper storage conditions.Good Manufacturing Practices: This includes proper sanitation of equipment and facilities, using high-quality raw materials, and maintaining proper processing conditions.Proper Storage Conditions: This includes storing the juice at the right temperature, pH, and water activity. It is also essential to protect the juice from sunlight and oxygen exposure.Conclusion and key takeawaysFood spoilage bacteria are ubiquitous and can cause undesirable changes in food, leading to a decline in quality, texture, flavor, and color. In heat-processed beverages such as juice, thermophilic, thermoduric, and spore-forming bacteria are the most common types of spoilage bacteria. Factors such as pH, water activity, nutrients, oxygen, and temperature can influence the growth and development of food spoilage bacteria in juice. Preventing the spoilage of heat-processed beverages requires good manufacturing practices and proper storage conditions. By understanding the role of food spoilage bacteria, we can take steps to prevent spoilage and ensure the quality and safety of our food products.Are you looking for expert advice on food quality?

Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality",CRISPR: The next revolution in food microbiology?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/crispr-the-next-revolution-in-food-microbiology/,"March 30, 2023","CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, which is a revolutionary genetic technology that allows scientists to make precise edits to DNA. It is based on a naturally occurring defense mechanism found in certain bacteria that allows them to recognize and destroy invading viruses by cutting their DNA.The CRISPR-Cas system works by using an RNA molecule to guide an enzyme called Cas9 to a specific location in the DNA, where it cuts the DNA strands. This cut can then be used to either delete, replace, or insert new genetic material at the desired location. This technology has the potential to transform a wide range of fields, including medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.CRISPR has already been used to treat genetic diseases such as sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis in preclinical studies, and has the potential to revolutionize the field of gene therapy. In agriculture, CRISPR can be used to create crops that are more resistant to pests and diseases, and that have improved nutritional content. The technology also has potential applications in environmental conservation and biofuel production.Despite its potential benefits, the use of CRISPR also raises ethical and safety concerns, such as the possibility of unintended genetic changes or the creation of new and potentially harmful organisms. However, with careful regulation and responsible use, CRISPR has the potential to transform the way we approach some of the most pressing challenges facing society today.The history of CRISPR technology is a story of scientific discovery that spans several decades and involves the contributions of many researchers. Here are some of the key milestones in the development of CRISPR technology:1987: The discovery of CRISPR: In 1987, a group of researchers studying the genome of the bacterium E. coli noticed a series of repeating DNA sequences separated by unique “spacer” sequences. These sequences were later named clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or CRISPR.1993: The first CRISPR-associated gene is identified: In 1993, researchers identified the first CRISPR-associated gene, cas1, which was found to be conserved across many different bacteria.2005: The role of CRISPR in bacterial immunity is discovered: In 2005, researchers showed that CRISPR plays a crucial role in bacterial immunity by protecting against viral infections. They found that bacteria incorporate short pieces of viral DNA into their CRISPR arrays, which allows them to recognize and destroy the viral DNA if it enters the cell again.2011: CRISPR is repurposed for genome editing: In 2011, researchers showed that the CRISPR system could be repurposed for genome editing by using a modified version of the Cas9 protein to cut DNA at specific sites in the genome. This allowed for precise and targeted editing of genes in a variety of organisms, including human cells.2012: CRISPR-Cas9 is demonstrated in human cells: In 2012, a team of researchers showed that the CRISPR-Cas9 system could be used to edit the genome of human cells. This breakthrough opened up new possibilities for using CRISPR in biomedical research and gene therapy.2013: CRISPR is used to correct genetic mutations: In 2013, researchers used CRISPR to correct a genetic mutation in human cells that causes a rare genetic disorder called Fanconi anemia. This marked the first time that CRISPR had been used to correct a genetic mutation in human cells.2015: CRISPR-Cas9 is used in agriculture: In 2015, researchers used CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the genome of crops, including tomatoes and wheat, to improve their yield and resistance to pests and disease.Since these breakthroughs, CRISPR technology has rapidly advanced, with new applications and improvements being developed every year. It is now widely recognized as one of the most promising and powerful tools in modern biotechnology.CRISPR is a new genetic technology that differs from traditional genetic engineering in several key ways.Firstly, traditional genetic engineering relies on a process called transgenesis, which involves inserting foreign genetic material into an organism’s DNA. This foreign genetic material is typically derived from a different species, and the insertion is often random and imprecise. In contrast, CRISPR allows for precise editing of an organism’s own DNA, without the need for foreign genetic material.Secondly, traditional genetic engineering often relies on trial and error, with scientists selecting the most desirable traits after many rounds of experimentation. CRISPR, on the other hand, allows for targeted and precise editing of specific genes, allowing scientists to achieve the desired trait with greater accuracy and efficiency.Thirdly, traditional genetic engineering often involves the use of viral vectors or other potentially harmful methods to deliver the foreign genetic material into an organism’s DNA. CRISPR, on the other hand, uses a naturally occurring bacterial defence mechanism that is much safer and more precise.Finally, traditional genetic engineering has been the subject of much controversy due to concerns about safety and potential unintended consequences. CRISPR, while still relatively new and untested, has the potential to avoid many of these concerns by allowing for precise and targeted editing of specific genes.In summary, CRISPR differs from traditional genetic engineering in that it allows for precise editing of an organism’s own DNA, without the need for foreign genetic material, and uses a safer and more precise delivery mechanism. While both technologies have potential benefits and risks, CRISPR represents a major step forward in the field of genetic engineering.CRISPR technology really has the potential to revolutionize the field of food microbiology by allowing scientists to precisely manipulate the genomes of foodborne pathogens, spoilage organisms, and probiotics. Here are some applications of CRISPR in food microbiology:Pathogen detection: CRISPR-based diagnostic tests can be developed to quickly and accurately detect foodborne pathogens, such asSalmonella,Listeria, andE. coli, in food samples. This can help prevent outbreaks of foodborne illness by allowing for rapid identification and response.Pathogen control: CRISPR can be used to modify the genomes of foodborne pathogens to make them less virulent or more susceptible to antibiotics. This could be used to reduce the risk of foodborne illness by decreasing the ability of pathogens to cause disease.Spoilage prevention: CRISPR can be used to modify the genomes of spoilage organisms, such as yeast and bacteria, to increase their tolerance to environmental stressors, such as temperature and pH. This could help prevent food spoilage and extend the shelf life of food products.Probiotic engineering: CRISPR can be used to modify the genomes of probiotics, such as lactic acid bacteria, to enhance their health benefits. For example, probiotics could be engineered to produce specific bioactive compounds that promote gut health.Crop improvement: CRISPR can be used to modify the genomes of crops to enhance their resistance to pests and disease, increase their nutritional value, and improve their yield. This could help address global food security challenges by increasing the productivity and sustainability of agriculture.While the applications of CRISPR in food microbiology are still in the early stages of development, the technology has the potential to transform the way we approach food safety, quality, and nutrition. By enabling precise and targeted genetic manipulations, CRISPR could help address some of the most pressing challenges facing the food industry today.","food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality",Ohmic heating in food processing,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/ohmic-heating-in-food-processing/,"March 16, 2023","Traditional food processing has relied on heat, which is particularly energy intensive.  So much energy is required and thus thermal processing is not environmentally sustainable.  Therefore, it is in the best interests of our planet to look at non-thermal processing techniques that can ultimately reduce our need for energy to produce safe food with a long shelf-life. Many non-thermal technologies have been investigated over the past 100+ years, but few are commercially available, and even fewer are in widespread use.  High pressure processing is one of the best success stories of non-thermal food processing technologies.  Ohmic heating isn’t widely known, yet is another technology with great potential to continue to a reduction in energy consumption. Let’s learn about it here…Ohmic heating, also known as Joule heating or electrical resistance heating, is a novel thermal processing technology that has been gaining popularity in the food industry in recent years. The process involves the application of an electric current to a food product, which results in the conversion of electrical energy into heat energy. Ohmic heating is considered a non-thermal processing method because it does not rely on external heating sources such as steam, hot air or hot water, but instead relies on the inherent resistance of the food to electric current to generate heat.The principle behind ohmic heating is based on the Joule effect, which describes the phenomenon of energy conversion that occurs when an electric current passes through a material with resistance. According to Ohm’s law, the current passing through a material is directly proportional to the voltage applied and inversely proportional to the resistance of the material. Therefore, if an electric current is passed through a material with resistance, such as food, heat will be generated due to the conversion of electrical energy into thermal energy.In the context of food processing, ohmic heating is typically achieved by passing an electric current through a food product that is placed between two electrodes. The electrodes are usually made of stainless steel and are positioned in such a way that the food product is in direct contact with them. When the electric current is applied, the food product heats up rapidly due to its resistance to the current, and the temperature is controlled by adjusting the voltage and current settings of the system.One of the main advantages of ohmic heating is its ability to provide rapid and uniform heating throughout the food product. Since the heat is generated directly within the food, there is no need for external heating sources, which can result in longer processing times and uneven heating. Ohmic heating can also be used to control the texture and color of food products, as well as to preserve the nutritional content of foods that are sensitive to high temperatures.Another advantage of ohmic heating is its ability to reduce the processing time required to achieve a desired level of microbial inactivation. The rapid heating provided by ohmic heating can lead to a significant reduction in the processing time required to achieve a desired level of microbial inactivation compared to traditional thermal processing methods. This is because ohmic heating can rapidly heat the food product to a high enough temperature to destroy microorganisms without causing significant thermal damage to the food itself.Ohmic heating has been successfully used in the processing of a variety of food products, including fruits and vegetables, meat and poultry, dairy products, and ready-to-eat meals. In the processing of fruits and vegetables, ohmic heating has been shown to be effective in reducing enzymatic activity and preserving the colour and texture of the products. In the processing of meat and poultry, ohmic heating has been shown to be effective in reducing the microbial load of the products while preserving their sensory quality. In the processing of dairy products, ohmic heating has been shown to be effective in reducing the heat load on the products, which can result in a longer shelf life.One of the challenges associated with ohmic heating is the development of suitable equipment that can withstand the high voltages and currents required for the process. The design of the electrodes is critical to the success of the process, as they must be able to withstand the high temperatures and pressures that can be generated during ohmic heating. Additionally, the electrical conductivity and resistance of the food product can vary depending on a number of factors, such as moisture content, pH, and salt content, which can make it difficult to achieve consistent heating throughout the product.In order to overcome these challenges, researchers are working to develop new electrode materials and designs that can withstand the rigors of ohmic heating, as well as new monitoring and control systems that can accurately measure the temperature and conductivity of the food product during processing.","food microbiology, food preservation, food processing, Food safety, foodborne disease"
Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality",Techniques of molecular food microbiology. Part 1: PCR,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/techniques-of-molecular-food-microbiology-part-1-pcr/,"January 30, 2023","Molecular food microbiology is a field of study that utilizes molecular biology techniques to understand the microorganisms present in food, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These techniques include PCR, DNA sequencing, and gene expression analysis, which allow for the identification, characterization, and quantification of microorganisms in food. The goal of molecular food microbiology is to improve the safety, quality, and shelf-life of food products by studying the microorganisms that can cause spoilage or food-borne illness. This knowledge can be used to design better food preservation methods and to develop new food safety guidelines.Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a laboratory technique that is used to amplify a specific segment of DNA. It was first described by Kary Mullis in 1983, and since then it has been widely used in various fields, including food microbiology. In food microbiology, PCR is used to detect and identify specific microorganisms, such as bacteria and viruses, in food samples. It is also used to detect and identify specific genetic markers associated with food-borne pathogens, such as Salmonella and E. coli. PCR has become an important tool in food safety and quality control, as it can quickly and accurately detect the presence of harmful microorganisms in food. Additionally, PCR-based methods have been used to authenticate the origin of food products, such as meat and dairy products.Some of the main applications of PCR in food microbiology include:Identification of microorganisms: PCR can be used to identify the specific microorganisms present in a food sample, such as E. coli, Salmonella, and Listeria. This information can be used to track the source of food-borne illness outbreaks and to monitor the effectiveness of food safety measures.Quantification of microorganisms: PCR can be used to quantify the number of microorganisms present in a food sample. This information can be used to assess the level of contamination in food products and to monitor the effectiveness of food preservation methods.Detection of antibiotic resistance: PCR can be used to detect the presence of genes associated with antibiotic resistance in microorganisms present in food. This information can be used to monitor the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the food supply and to guide the development of new food safety measures.Traceability: PCR can also be used to track the origin of food products, such as meat, dairy, and seafood, by identifying the specific microorganisms present at each step of the food production process.Detection of food fraud: PCR can be used to detect the presence of specific microorganisms or genetic markers that indicate the origin of food products, which can be used to detect food fraud, such as the mislabeling of products or the use of lower-quality ingredients.Detection of pathogenic microorganisms: PCR can be used to detect pathogenic microorganisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes, E. coli O157:H7, and Salmonella spp., that cause food-borne illness.Prototype polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machine (prototype – object genre)byUnknown makeris licensed underCC-BY-NC-SA 4.0There are several types of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) that are commonly used in food microbiology to detect and identify microorganisms present in food samples. These include:Traditional PCR: This is the most basic form of PCR, which amplifies a specific DNA sequence using a set of primers that bind to the ends of the target sequence.Real-time PCR: This is a variation of PCR that allows for the quantification of the target DNA sequence in real-time, by measuring the amount of PCR product as it is produced.Multiplex PCR: This is a PCR method that allows for the simultaneous amplification of multiple DNA sequences using multiple sets of primers.Nested PCR: This is a PCR method that involves two rounds of amplification, with the second round using a set of primers that bind within the amplified product of the first round. This allows for the detection of low levels of target DNA and to improve the specificity of the PCR assay.Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR): This method is used to amplify RNA sequences, which are converted to cDNA by reverse transcription before the PCR amplification. It is used to detect and quantify RNA viruses, such as norovirus in food samples.Quantitative PCR (qPCR): This is a variation of PCR that allows for the quantification of the target DNA sequence. qPCR can be used to determine the amount of a specific microorganism in a sample, which can be useful in monitoring the effectiveness of food preservation methods.Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP): This is a PCR method that is used to amplify DNA sequences at a constant temperature, which can be useful for the detection of microorganisms in field settings.PCR-ELISA: This is a PCR method that combines the specificity of PCR with the sensitivity of ELISA, which is used to detect the presence of specific microorganisms or genetic markers in food samples.The choice of the PCR method will depend on the type of microorganism being targeted, the sample matrix, and the available equipment and expertise.KSC-2015-2377byNASAKennedyis licensed underCC-BY-NC 2.0","food microbiology, Food safety, food science, microbiology, molecular biology, PCR, polymerase chain reaction"

Food quality,"eukaryotic-microbiology, food-quality, fungi, yeast",Fungal contamination of food and how to control it,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/fungal-contamination-of-food-and-how-to-control-it/,"April 26, 2022","This is the final article in our series of fungal spoilage of food products, originally written by Doreen Ting from RMIT University in 2008.  As her project facilitator, I have made some changes to her piece below, but it is largely as per her original submission.Source of Spoilage YeastFood may be susceptible to spoilage with fungal contamination from a variety of sources. This may be from the environment (for example soil, air, and water) or from poor manufacturing process while intrinsic characteristics of the food (such as pH, water activity, and sugar concentration) can increase the likelihood of growth of these fungal contaminants (Ray, 2004; Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). The most commonly food spoiled by yeast, as mentioned earlier are fruits. Fruits, as received at processing plants, are often contaminated with large amounts of yeasts. In some cases, fruits that have been damaged before reaching processing plants, due to poor handling or damaged by birds or insects may contain significantly higher yeast populations (Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). Due to the exposed tissues of these damaged fruits, yeasts are introduced, thus enabling them to use the naturally occurring sugar and nutrients in the fruit to support their growth.Physiological characteristic of the food itself may also encourage the growth of yeast thus leading to spoilage. This may be due to several reasons, which includes: (i) pH value of food; (ii) water activity; and (iii) sugar concentration. Favourable growth conditions for yeast are in foods with low pH values (Martorell et al., 2006; Praphailong & Fleet, 1997;). As mentioned earlier, several species of the yeast genusZygosaccharomyces, were reported growing at a water activity level down to 0.62 (Frazier & Westhoff, 2005; Martorell et al., 2004) and some at a pH value as low as 2.5 (Steels et al., 1999). It is reported that food with a high concentration of sugars are also particularly at risk besides food with low pH (Tilbury 1980, cited in Steels et al. 1999; Thomas & Davenport, 1985; Tournas & Katsoudas; 2005).  As stated by Tournas & Katsoudas (2005), fruits in general contain high concentration of sugar favourable to yeast, which was mentioned earlier (i.e. glucose and fructose), the ideal water activity level with their low pH level thus making them particularly susceptible to spoilage by yeast.Poor manufacturing process may also contribute to spoilage of foods. Processing of food in a non-hygienic environment may lead to contamination of the food and thus leading to spoilage. Food produced in a non-hygienic environment introduces hazards, which can adversely affect the stability of the food product (Vasconcellos, 2004). Introduction of food spoilers at the very start of production increases the risk of food spoilage. Although most spoilers may be killed during processing especially during heat treatment, some yeast strains have the ability to survive in heat-stressed environment (Raso et al., 1998; Tran & Farid, 2004).As stated previously, the low pH of many fruits is the major factor that places them at risk of spoilage by yeast. Despite having most yeasts removed during early stages of processing (i.e. washing and peeling), recontamination can subsequently occur wherever there is opportunity for yeast to growth in later processing stages (Worobo & Splittstoesser, 2005). The use of contaminated equipments for processing (i.e. conveyor belts, slicers, fillers) are potential sources of contamination. Research conducted by Martorell et al. (2007) on yeast strains isolated from a high sugar environment (i.e. candied fruits and nougats) demonstrated resistance to preservatives however, did not show exceptional resistance to biocides such as peracetic acid and hypochlorite. The authors indicated that yeast spoilers might best be prevented through the use of biocidal agents in the factory rather than treating the food with preservatives. Food manufacturers are required to comply with the Codex Alimentarius: Recommended International Code of Practice – General Principles of Food Hygiene (Codex Alimentarius, 2003). In Australia, food manufacturers are required to operate in accordance with the Food Standards Australia New Zealand, which aims to control food safety hazards during production, manufacture, and handling of food (FSANZ, 2008).According to Tapia and Welti-Chanes (2002), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) systems are important tools used by the food industry for production of microbiologically safe food. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) involves general principles of hygiene whereas the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system involves identification of possible hazards and preventative measures necessary for the control of hazards (Vasconcellos, 2004).Control/Prevention MethodsAccording to Loureiro (2000), the consequence of food spoilage is a severe economical loss to the food industry because of the large scale at which food products are made. Due to its detrimental effects to the food industry, food microbiologists have continued to research on various methods in terms of controlling the growth of yeasts. As stated by van der Vossen & Hofstra (1996), it is advantageous to know the identity of the spoilage organism present in the product before designing strategies to prevent spoilage. Amongst the method used for identification and characterisation of spoilage yeast are: (i) analysis of long-chain fatty acids (Loureiro, 2000), and (ii) DNA based identification technology including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Casey & Dobson, 2003; Rawsthorne & Phister, 2006; Renard et al., 2008; van der Vossen & Hofstra, 1996) (iii) monitoring of isoenzymes patterns (Duarte et al., 2004; Loureiro, 2000).As mentioned earlier in the review, several yeast species are able to survive in stressed environments, which include presence of weak-acid preservatives. One species in particular known for its exceptional ability to resist weak-acid preservatives isZygosaccharomyces bailii(Andrews et al., 1997; Steels et al., 1999; Thomas & Davenport, 1985). Inactivation of this particular species was found only in environments with high levels of preservatives (El Halouat et al., 1998). However, due to legal limitations, researchers opted for combination of hurdles to achieve this. Though the mechanism of this has not been thoroughly understood, researchers have continued to carry out experiments on a combination of hurdles in preventing the growth of yeast in food. Weak-acid preservatives used along with pH adjustments (Cole & Keenan, 1986; Nielsen & Arneborg, 2007; Quintas et al., 2004), use of heat with combination of high hydrostatic pressure and pulsed electric field (Raso et al., 1998), and use of different type and amount of carbon source (Levya et al., 1999; Merico et al., 2003) were amongst the methods used in controlling the growth of yeast.Nevertheless, there has been increasing demand for foods with reduced amounts of chemical additives and less physical damage (Palou et al., 1997), in other words minimally processed food. This has lead researchers to investigate the use of modified atmospheric packaging as another alternative in preserving food products from yeast contaminants. Lucas (2003) view modified atmospheric packaging as a technique of shelf-life extension, which involves a mixture of gases including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Restuccia et al., (2006) reported that modified atmospheric packaging in combination with hurdles (i.e. temperature), work synergistically in maintaining freshness, extending shelf life and ensuring the safety of food. El Halouat & Debevere (1996), who conducted a research on the influence of modified atmosphere and preservatives on the growth ofZygosaccharomyces rouxiiisolated from dried fruits, reported on the synergistic effects of inhibiting factors such as low water activity level, preservatives and carbon dioxide. El Halouat et al.

This is my report, outlining the mythology and results.Milk collection and transportMilk was collected from five sampling locations on 9 August 2005.  The locations comprised three farms (Farm A, Farm B, Farm C), the tanker which collected milk from those three farms on that day and silo 1 and the milk processing plant.  From each of the farms, samples were collected aseptically from the bulk tank into sterile, precooled (to approximately 0 ºC) sample jars.  Milk from the tanker (through the hatch on top of the tanker) or from the silo (through the door near the base of the silo) were also collected into sterile precooled (to approximately 0 ºC) sample jars.  The milk samples were kept in ice/water at approximately 0 ºC until the samples arrived at the laboratory in Melbourne, up to 18 h later.  Once the samples were at the laboratory facility, they were kept at approximately 0 ºC until analysis or further use, which was within 3h.Storage simulationTo simulate some possible storage scenarios that the raw milk could be exposed to, milk from each farm and the silo was stored at 4 ºC and 10 ºC for up to 7d.AnalysisUpon receipt in the laboratory, enumeration to determine the total plate count (on Plate Count Agar with an incubation period of 72 h at 30 ºC) and the psychrotrophicPseudomonascount (on Pseudomonas Agar Base plus C-F-C supplement with an incubation period of 240 h at 7 ºC) was carried out.  Enumeration by these methods were performed daily, as was pH measurement.  A portion of the milk from each day’s sampling was stored in an ultracold freezer, to be analysed later for lipase (triolein assay) and protease (FITC-casein assay) as well as free fatty acids (extraction/titration method and GC) and free amino groups (fluorescamine assay and CE).Presumptive identificationRepresentatives from each colony type growing on Pseudomonas Agar Base plus C-F-C supplement were selected for further investigation.  Initially this involved purification of the culture on non-selective media followed by Gram staining and testing for the presence of oxidase.  Those pure isolates which were oxidase positive Gram negative rods were presumptively identified as psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp., as they had been isolated from a plate selective forPseudomonasspp.Screening for lipase and proteaseAn agar diffusion method was used to screen the isolates for lipase and/or protease production.  Nutrient Agar plates containing either 0.1% triolein (for lipase) or 1% low-fat milk (for protease) were used.  The agar was poured in layers.  From the first layer, portions of the agar were removed using a 6 mm sterile cork borer.  To each well, a 10 μL volume of a 25 ºC-grown Nutrient Broth culture containing 108cfu/mL were added.  The plates were incubated for 168 h at 4 ºC with observations recorded after 93 h, as well as at the end of the incubation period.  The diameter of the zones were measured and recorded, as were the number of zones.ResultsColony counts on collected milkBoth total and psychrotrophic plate counts were low across all farms.  However, there were differences between the locations and especially between the farms.  Farm 1 (on every second day collection) had a comparatively low total count, at 2.5 x 103cfu/mL, particularly when compared with Farm 3 (on daily collection) which had a total plate count approximately ¾ of a log higher (Table 1).Table 1: Colony counts on raw milk on day of collection.Farm 12.5 x 103cfu/mL6.2 x 101cfu/mL (2.5% of total)Farm 27.0 x 102cfu/mL9.8 x 101cfu/mL (14.0% of total)Farm 39.0 x 103cfu/mL1.2 x 103cfu/mL (13.4% of total)Tanker5.0 x 103cfu/mL1.5 x 103cfu/mL (30.0% of total)Silo (#1)4.0 x 103cfu/mL2.0 x 103cfu/mL (50.0% of total)Colimn 1: Source of milk. Column 2: Total plate count. Column 3: PsychrotrophicPseudomonasplate countThe proportion of psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. in this total count was widely variable.  On Farm 1, these organisms comprised just 2.5% of the flora compared to the silo, where half of the microbes encountered were psychrotrophicPseudomonasspp. (Table 1).Growth of milk microflora during storageClear differences were observed between the storage temperatures with the microflora in the milk stored at 10 ºC reaching stationary phase, sometime shortly after 48 h compared to the 4 ºC stored milk, where the microflora entered stationary phase after approximately 120 h of storage (Figure 1).  The growth curve from the 4 ºC stored milk showed a typical lag phase (0-2d), exponential phase (3-5d) and stationary phase (5-7 d).  Differences in the composition of the microflora were apparent because rates of growth varied.  The total count from Farm 2 was the lowest of all samples at the commencement of the incubation period.  However, after 72 h of incubation, it increased above the level of Farm 1, which started with a total count approximately half a log higher.The psychrotrophicPseudomonascounts were quite low at the start of incubation for some locations, but generally increased to a level where the growth curves were similar to the total counts (Figure 2).  As is known, pseudomonads often didn’t display a prominent lag phase.  The Farm 2 psychrotrophicPseudomonascount results in fact, looked to be in exponential phase from 0-5d.Figure 1:Figure 2:","dairy farm, dairy products, dairy technology, food microbiology, food preservation, food science, food spoilage, microbiology, milk, raw milk"
Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality, food-spoilage",The future of practical food microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-future-of-practical-food-microbiology/,"January 29, 2022","How we work within food microbiology – important topics … and the techniques and conceptual approaches that make it happen.Molecular methodologies dominate practical aspects of modern biology – food, environmental and agricultural microbiology is no exception.  However, it is more important for analytical methodologies in these areas of microbiology to focus on accuracy and precision rather than speed.  In other areas of food microbiology, such as food safety investigations during disease outbreaks, where rapid results are especially important, rapid and sometimes real-time methods are vital.  However, speed is relatively unimportant when detecting and identifying microorganisms in the context of food fermentations, environmental microbiology studies and agricultural microbiology.  Thus, time to result is relatively unimportant, whereas getting as close as possible to the correct result is paramount, even if the “correct result” is an unknown bacterial species.  Sometimes, obtaining any result may not be possible at all, which is one of the challenges.Unlike other areas of microbiology, like food safety outbreak investigations, many a time, work in these areas has more of a focus on investigation and detection of non-standard or rare microorganisms.  Such investigations could very well involve novel microorganisms, completely new to science.  Therefore, by and large, a different approach is required, compared to those fields of microbiology which routinely involve investigation of typical, known and expected microorganisms.  The idea ‘you find what you look for’ is so true in these particular microbiology analyses, where, in the case of environmental samples, very few microorganisms may be culturable, despite being metabolically active.  Consequently, what doesn’t work that well in environmental microbiology investigations are comparison of results to known databases or using known PCR primers.  As a result, investigative protocols based on 16s rRNA tend to work best (Benllochet al., 1995).  There will still be some limitations if a PCR methodology is employed, but independent testing regimes exist (Rosselliet al., 2016), which therefore do away with the limitation of the use of primers to known gene sequences.Molecular and spectroscopic approaches to analytical microbiologyPrior to the era of routine molecular biology, traditional cultural and biochemical methods, relying on genetic differences manifesting as observable phenotypic differences, were the mainstay of bacterial detection and identification, in food microbiology and indeed other areas of microbiology.  However, since 1995 when the first bacterial genome was sequenced, molecular genetics, in particular of whole genomes, has moved into the area of semi-routine.  Previously limited by technical capabilities, the shortcomings of combining numerous short DNA sequences were largely overcome, at least in a practical sense in certain applications by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).  However, this has been rapidly superseded by whole genome sequencing (WGS), used increasingly for routine foodborne disease outbreak investigations of an epidemiological nature.  This allows for unprecedented levels of precision in strain distinction and hence for determining relatedness, allowing for previously unmatched levels of understanding in the development and movement of bacterial pathogens.Workflow of whole genome sequencing in a laboratory.In addition, the interface of biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics as a combination in various areas of applied microbiology, allows for the development of practical approaches to solving real-world problems in food microbiology that have never been possible.  For example, while the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) isn’t new in the context of food quality analysis, it is now being refined and extended into a new level of precision for pathogenic bacterial detection in food products.  This, and other approaches, such as electrochemical-based sensor technology for detection of spoilage bacteria within food products offers quick and precise analysis that isn’t invasive.  Overall, the field of molecular microbiology is more prominent than ever, with various omics techniques, in particular genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, becoming an increasing indispensable part of modern microbiology.  As in all areas of biology, going (or gone!) are the days of purely phenotypic characterisation as being sufficient.  Today demands a greater understanding, to levels never before seen, as we delve deep into cell biology and genetics, unlocking secrets with increasing capabilities due to contributions from diverse fields of chemistry, physics and mathematics, that combine, to propel analytical microbiology to a whole new era in the coming years.https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0039914016308281-fx1.jpgReal-time on-site near infrared spectroscopy analysis.Progress on approaches to grow microorganisms that cannot be grown as yet,The topic of this section can be related to either those bacterial cells that have never been cultured, and it is understood that an estimated 99% of all species of Archaea and Bacteria are yet to be cultured, or in the so-called viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state, a concept developed some 40 years ago by Xuet al.(1982) to describe the survival mechanism state where normally culturable bacterial cells that are metabolically active, enter into a state of being unable to be cultured.  This would essentially result in false negative readings in microbiologically food analysis, where the metabolically active bacterial cells are in fact present, but although unable to grow and form colonies on artificial media, may certainly still be virulent and remain in a state of pathogenicity.  Thus, Fakruddinet al.(2013) states that negative microbiological test results from food products cannot necessarily be considered from pathogens.  A key feature of the preceding section is the fact that molecular level and omics techniques are contributing to bring forth elements of discovery previously unheard of, and thus enabling their incorporation into routine commercial, industrial  and/or diagnostic practice.  This too, is a key feature here, where DNA analysis techniques are likely to offer improved opportunities for exploring the largely unexplored microbial world in the context of food microbiology.  This could very well provide some breakthrough moments in industrial and/or public health challenges and furthermore, may offer new opportunities to be developed, in potentially unknown ways, from the identification, genome sequence of and industrial/research use of potentially undiscovered microorganisms.  A practical consideration is how to survey and collect microorganisms from a whole range of extreme environments on our planet.  There were great limitations on advancements in this field prior to the widespread availability of molecular analysis tools.  Despite the benefits of a molecular-based approach, Rampelotto (2013) states that the modern techniques of molecular biology, when used in combination with traditional cultural methods, will deliver the best approach.https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/237514/fmicb-08-00580-HTML/image_m/fmicb-08-00580-g001.jpgDevelopment of the viable but nonculturable state in bacterial food borne

Bacteriophage, or phage for short, are viruses of bacteria, meaning that bacteriophage therapy is a biological control concept, and is a natural approach to combat bacteria.  As phage, like all viruses, are non-living entities, meaning they don’t fulfil the criteria for life, they are dependent on bacteria for their survival.  Therefore, no (bacterial) host cells, no phage.  Thus, it is impossible for them to proliferate out of control.  While bacteriophage therapy for human infectious disease dates back around a hundred years at its peak, a newer concept is phage-based biocontrol of foodborne pathogens and bacterial spoilage microorganisms.  This would tick all the boxes for a safe and effective, natural approach to handle the public and economic burden of foodborne disease, plus the economic losses associated with the growth of spoilage bacteria.

Raw milk tends to contain mostly spoilage bacteria, mainly Gram negative species.Pseudomonasspecies can dominate or be relatively scarce.

It has relevance from both the perspective of food safety (for example withListeria monocytogenes) as well as food quality and spoilage (for example withPseudomonas fragi).  Psychrotrophic microorganisms are those that have a optimal growth temperature similar to mesophilic microorganisms, yet, they are capable of growth at refrigeration temperatures.  They are typically present in low concentrations in food products, but refrigerated storage selects for these psychrotrophs as the lower temperature inhibits the growth of mesophiles.  The inhibition of mesophilic growth allows the psychrotrophs to grow, essentially without competition, thereby eventually spoiling the product if given enough time.  Therefore, it is important to remember that refrigeration delays microbial spoilage of food because it largely selects for psychrotrophic microorganisms.

Otherwise, metabolites during their normal growth can impact food quality, and of course safety too.

Food quality,food-quality,Predictive modelling in food microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/predictive-modelling-in-food-microbiology/,"June 26, 2021","As I was browsing through topics to write about, I came across an article on predictive microbiological modelling developed for botulism prediction. Albeit lesser known, and usually not discussed widely, predictive modelling has been used in various fields – from election results and climatic events to deep learning and email spam detection. As such, I decided to write a short article explaining predictive microbiology and its current use in the food industry.In predictive microbiology, a simplified approach is taken to measure microbial responses under defined parameters, which is then expressed in a mathematical equation. Using the same, one can predict responses to a different set of conditions, that was not included in the original testing. Historically, the first proposed model was the classical log-linear model of bacterial inactivation by heat shown in Fig 1 (Bigelow & Esty, 1920), which was followed by several other bacterial growth kinetic models – Arrhenius model, cardinal temperature model, and gamma concept model etc. Using these, one can predict bacterial growth, inactivation or death, metabolite or toxin production to also finding the absolute limits for several microbes in food environments.Fig 1: Thermal death point curve for several thermophilic microorganismsTo begin with, we will define some parameters that’s common use in predictive modelling. Generally speaking, a model can be built in the following way.Input parameters -> Function or Relation -> Output responseOr the mathematical function explaining the above can be expressed in a linear function asY=αX1+βX2+γX3+ εwhere Y is the dependent variable or the output response,  (X1X2X3) are the independent variables or the input parameters, (αβγ) are the regression coefficients which explain the functional relationship between the variables and ε is the error. Another case would be a non-linear model, expressed asY= eαX+εWhich is mostly used in predictive microbiology to describe concentration change over time, or other physical processes such as microbial transfer, metabolite production etc. As we translate these ideas into food safety principles, food scientists often use a risk-based approach called quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) to identify hazards and controls. The process involves characterizing a risk (pathogen) both quantitatively and qualitatively, in various combinations to eliminate the associated uncertainty in achieving a safe product.  Now we will look at various kinds of primary, and secondary models explaining the kinetics and few examples for each.Primary models: Estimates the growth kinetics as a function of time. Usually, it describes microbial concentration increase or decrease over time due to extrinsic or intrinsic factors (Fig 1), and the obtained results are only applicable under the same conditions considered during the model building. The famous bacterial growth curve with lag, exponential, stationary and death phase is an example of the primary model (Fig 2). One may wonder, where do primary model finds their use? These primary models are used extensively in developing high-temperature kill treatments for spore-forming bacteria and sterilization techniques (UHT, HTST etc).Fig 2: Log bacterial cell number described as a function of time using  log-linear modelNow that we know what primary models are, let’s move on to secondary modelling. Generally, secondary models arise when you want to describe the relationship between several factors, say water activity, temperature, pH, salt concentration etc. on the final outcome or dependent variable. One example is the response-surface methodology, which are secondary models, where polynomial equations of various orders are used, and usually expressed as contour plots (2D) or surface plots (3D; Fig 3). The correlation coefficient (R2) is obtained for each model, and higher the value, better the fit of the model. An important benefit of using such models is that one can easily optimize any food formulations to achieve the combination of factors that will inhibit or grow the microbes.Fig 3: Biomass concentration described as an effect of Yeast Extract and Peptone concentration using response surface methodologyAs we continue exploring, one can also use several software tools that can be used for modelling; Examples include Matlab, MiniTab, GInaFit, MicroHibro among many others. GInaFit, Matlab, and Minitab have an excel component, where users can input data, and select a model to run the equation, which results in an output tab with necessary data fitting performed. Closer to home, MLA (Meat and Livestock Australia) has anE. coliinactivation model tool that allows manufacturers to assess their fermenting conditions and their efficacy in killingE. coli. Jessica et al (2019) have developed a predictive model forSalmonellainactivation in infant formula using microwave processing. The researchers selected five distinctSalmonellastrains, which were later subjected to heat inactivation treatment using microwave heating. Bacterial enumeration was performed in intervals, and different survival models (Log-linear, Biphasic, Square root models) were constructed using GinaFit, and logCFU/mL graphs were plotted against time (Fig 4). As discussed earlier, R2(correlation coefficient) and error was calculated (R2= 0.98), and model validation was performed by calculating the predictive efficacy. This has serious food safety implications, asSalmonellainfections  causing diarrheal diseases account for almost one quarter of all the cases in the world. While we work towards global food safety, developing countries with limited resources can implement such food processing techniques that are available firsthand to alleviate their risks.Fig 4: Inactivation graphs forSalmonella Typhiiusing microwave heating at different time & power settingsAnother real-world use of predictive modelling can be seen in global supply chain, where one can employ predictive models to monitor intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and effectively maximising the shelf-life and preventing any food safety incidents. As technology advances in an ever-increasing rate, sensors can provide real-time data to integrated predictive models, by monitoring food safety variables. Tamplin (2018) discusses how food quality and safety can be monitored , and reports on several  predictive models developed for supply chain management. One such example is theVibriobacterium models for oysters – where the variables include seawater surface temperature, harvesting season, region, and water activity. As a model is developed, companies can investigate different scenarios and excersise their control strategies in each step of their supply chain to minimize food spoilage and improve safety. One can build a primary model and others can build upon it for different foods, targetting a myriad of microbes, ultimately providing better food safety for everyone.Although incredibly useful, there are some limitations to predictive modelling. Most models are developed on the assumption that microbial responses are predictable and consistent, and any inconsistencies associated with the responses are at times designated and analysed aserrorsandoutput variationsduring verification. Consequently, cross validation is crucial when using your model to make food safety decisions, asvalidity shrinkage– a term refering to predictive modelling’s validity reduction when you take a sample from a different population other than the sample used originally to develop the model –  should be accounted for, and one should make sure to incorporate this to maximise the model’s accuracy during testing. Increase the sample size, and collect data from varied population, and incorporate prior studies that may provide specific knowledge on your parameters and variables. As such, be wary of using one too many parameters, as it may result in multicollinearity – a condition where independent variables seemingly depend on each other which weakens the statistical significance, as variables need to be distinct and independent during modelling.ReferencesBigelow, W.

Food quality,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage","For accurate (niche) information in food science, go to an expert.",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/for-accurate-niche-information-in-food-science-go-to-an-expert/,"March 15, 2021","Mainstream media certainly has a place to play in dissemination of information.  However, I don’t believe the place or a role of mainstream media is to write about scientific topics of public health importance, giving advice and interpretation of various aspects that could result in a life or death choice.  Such topics must be left to the professionals.  The idea for this blog article came to mind when I was reading an article indelishdated 12 March 2021 (link below this paragraph), written by Kristin Salaky.  Just to be clear, I don’t have anything against Kristin Salaky as a person (I had never heard of her until reading this article of hers) or her writingper se.  She isn’t a food scientist, not even a scientist, so she can’t be blamed for the errors in her article.  For the record, Kristin has a bachelor degree in journalism from Ohio University and her LinkedIn profile says she has “…a background in women’s and gender studies as well as health…”, yet she is writing on food science.  The problem I have is that mainstream of generic publications for the general public have non-specialists with no real understanding or knowledge writing about topics that could result in a life or death choice – yes, it really is that serious!  Let me take you through parts of her article and explain.Yes, You Can Probably Eat Food (Slightly!) After Its Expiration Date — DelishWhile it is certainly true that food past the Use By date might be safe to eat, the Use By date is there for a reason.  The reason is to let you know the last date the food is guaranteed to be safe to eat.  Yes, true, if it has only been a day or two past the Use By, then it could very well still be ok – I eat food past it’s Use By date, but I consider various factors in making that choice, and I have the benefit of professional understanding in food safety and experience.  Therefore, for consumers, it is certainly not advisable to consume food past it’s Use By date, under any circumstances.  Kristin goes on to say that if the food has no signs of spoilage, then you can make the assumption that the food is safe to eat.  Unfortunately, she is confusing what is probably the most fundamental aspect of food safety and quality, and in the process, misleading readers, which could make a choice based on what she has written, with dire consequences.  Firstly, I must say, she has it wrong – spoilage is unrelated to safety and if a food is not spoiled, that does not mean in any way, shape or form, that you can draw a conclusion about that food’s microbial safety.  The two are independent from one another, not related at all.  This is the reason why there are Use By dates (for food safety purposes) and Best Before dates (for food quality purposes).  A food that is spoiled is almost certainly safe, albeit unpleasant, to eat.  Spoilage microorganisms cannot make you sick.  Foodborne disease comes from eating food contaminated with foodborne pathogenic microorganisms, or their toxins.  These microorganisms or their toxins are present in such low amounts (yet can still cause disease) that you have no way, absolutely no way, or knowing if they are present or not.  Think about, if people could tell if a food was safe to eat because of the way it looked or the smell of it, would people be getting a foodborne disease?  If unsafe food smelled or looked bad or off, nobody would eat it and nobody won’t get foodborne disease.  The fact is, unsafe food smells, looks and tastes normal, completely normal.Again, the above extract from the article in question shows erroneous information.  Curdled milk or slimy meat will be safe to drink/eat, but will of course be extremely unpleasant!  So, I need to reiterate, if it look good and smells good, you can’t say that the food is probably safe, not by a long shot.  Looking good or smelling good is no way related to the microbial safety of a food.It is true that food won’t necessarily be unsafe on a specific date.  For certain foods, as per the food regulations for that country, food manufacturers need to include a Use By date.  However, it is a date that is selected with a margin of error included.   Food waste is a problem, and many safe foods are discarded because they are passed their Use By date.  While discarding food that is past it’s Use By date is what needs to be done, it does certainly result in a degree of unnecessary wastage of good food.  As I’ve outlined, you cannot tell if a food is safe to consume or eat from how it looks or smells, so how can you?  Well, it is a complex process and food safety professionals would use various factors to come to a conclusion in this regard.If you want an question on Use By or Best Before dates, including if a particular food is safe or not, feel free to contact me directly for advice or an answer:You can e-mail me: philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academyOr get a (nearly) instant answer by contacting me on WhatsApp!Chat on WhatsApp",
Food quality,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",Essentials of food safety and quality,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/essentials-of-food-safety-and-quality/,"February 26, 2021","Society’s shift away from nomadic lifestyles to plant/animal domestication and urbanisationIt is generally acknowledged that the first agricultural revolution began around 10 000 BC with the domestication of animals and plants, before which time, society practiced the ‘hunter gatherer’ lifestyle of hunting animals and gathering fruits/vegetables for short term, often daily consumption.  This involved simple food preservation techniques by individuals and  families, like drying (Figure 1) and fermenting, which extended the availability of their own stock of fresh foods.  However, with the second (British) agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution, in particular, came urbanisation and the need for longer, commercial-scale safe storage of food.  This was because the distance from production to market grew significantly, as cities grew, which were typically located some distance from rural areas of food primary production.  Furthermore, this need for increased safe storage of food on a commercial scale also enabled the manufactured food industry to develop thermal processing, such as canning, which is also a way that food can be stored for long(er) periods of time.  However, we now increasing are aware of the negative aspects of thermal processing on organoleptic and nutritional quality.  While thermal techniques remain the mainstay of food processing, newer non-thermal technologies are gaining ground, such as high pressure processing (HPP).  From hunter gatherer nomadic lifestyles to high pressure processing – looking forward to seeing what exciting developments the world of food microbiology has in store.Figure 1: Drying herbs to preserve them.Food quality and spoilageThe ultimate reason for food preservation and the need to safely store food is because it “goes off”.  We are all familiar with the concept of food “going off”, with mouldy bread and fruits or slimy meat (Figure 2) for example.  Although these are, by and large, the more commonly encountered causes of food spoilage, there are others.  For example, lumpiness (age gelation, which results from specific protein complexes forming) or sedimentation in UHT (long-life) milk (which results from enzyme action degrading the protein) or the white (or pale yellow) coloured pineapple juice (resulting from ultraviolet light stimulated degradation reactions of the colour compounds).  Food preservation is generally concerned with the maintenance of the quality of food, and consequently to prevent its spoilage and ultimate contribution to the significant (and growing) food waste problem.Figure 2: Spoiled meat.Foodborne disease and food safetyWhat is regarded as foodborne disease can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic.  These types of microorganisms tend to cause foodborne disease in characteristic ways from characteristic foods.  Due to the way and ease with  which foodborne viruses tend to be spread, they tend to be the most common microorganisms.  The faecal-oral route, common with foodborne viruses such as Rotavirus that causes diarrhoea, is a commonly occurring, and easily preventable, means of transmitting foodborne disease.  Pathogenic bacteria are widespread in the natural and artificial environment, grow well in many foods and thrive at temperatures typical of temperature abuse of foods.  Yeast and moulds, although more widespread than bacteria, grow slower than bacteria and tend to be outgrown by bacteria, except in high acid and low water activity foods -intrinsic product parameters which will largely inhibit bacterial growth.  Protozoan parasites and parasitic worms are even less common, as they usually have complex life cycles (Figure 3), sometimes requiring multiple hosts.  They also grow more slowly (than prokaryotes) and have quite narrow requirements for growth parameters.Figure 3: Life cycle ofToxoplasma gondiiExpiry dates: The difference between Use By and Best BeforeA vital distinction to know is the difference between Use By dates and Best Before dates (Figure 4), and how this relates to shelf-life.  To start with though, a common misconception is that unsafe food is somehow different in taste, smell and so, from safe food.  This is almost certainly never true – if that was the case, few people would contract a foodborne disease.  The fact is that the unpleasant changes you see or smell in or on food, are most often the  result of the growth of spoilage microorganisms, which are typically harmless.  Yes, it might be unpleasant to consume some of them, but they won’t make you sick.  They are not pathogenic and have no way to cause disease.  The onset of these unpleasant changes with food can signal the end of shelf-life.  In practice, it is usually subtle quality changes that happen before then, that determine a Best Before date, such as a reduction in crispness of a potato chip, or the way a sauce flows out of the bottle or the reduced carbonation of soft drinks.  The Use By date on the other hand is all about safety – after the Use By date, that food is considered unsafe to eat, and should be discarded.  This is on contrast to the Best Before date, after which, a reduction in expected product quality may be apparent, but the food or drink will still be perfectly safe to consume.Figure 4: The distinction between Use By dates and Best Before dates.",
Food quality,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",Our first 50,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/our-first-50/,"February 3, 2021","We’ve hit the half century!  Between 22 December 2019 and today, 3 February 2021, we’ve published 50 blog articles.  What a journey and what a great time we’ve had growing, learning and lending our expertise to solve real-world issues for our clients in different parts of the world.The Food Microbiology Academy journey started during the Black Friday sales of November 2019, with the upgrade of our WordPress website, then we registered our domain name shortly thereafter, and pushed out our first blog article on our website three days before Christmas.  We started with an intention of engaging in primarily research activities, with teaching to support it.  However, it was evident in January 2020 that our expertise in the food preservation space was valued, and we finished a couple of small consulting projects early in February 2020 for clients in London and New York.  Wow yes, our first two clients were located in the two most significant global cities!  During the course of the year we continued to build on our early success in consulting, and took on a Taipei-located lead food safety auditor to our team.  With her industry experience in QC and understanding of bakery manufacture, coupled with her sharp and exacting knowledge of food safety, we greatly expanded our capacity.After working with clients in Bali, Calgary (Alberta, Canada) and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex in the United States, among others, we are now in a position to expand our service offerings and capabilities beyond consulting to the food manufacturing industry.  To this end, we have finalised appointment of someone located in Sydney that will lead our education and training programs, initially online courses in microbiology, but ultimately training programs for the food manufacturing industry.What have we learnt?  As much as I (Philip) was thinking that food safety was what I wanted to be actively involved in, that really doesn’t seem the understanding and expertise the industry needs.  I’m a bacteriologist, and tended to be more interested in food safety.  However, I found that my interests and expertise wasn’t that relevant and it was more mycology along with food quality and spoilage expertise that is actually more useful when consulting to the food manufacturing industry.  Many people wish to optimise or extend the shelf-life of their manufactured food products, and it typically isn’t bacteria that are limiting the shelf-life, more often it is mould growth.  So I found myself getting excited about yeasts and moulds and spoiled food, then working with either I) established small to medium food manufacturers to troubleshoot mould-based spoilage issues and/or extend the shelf-life of those products, particular so that new export markets could be reached or II) food entrepreneurs who need shelf-life and food preservation advice to simply know how long their product will remain stable for.  Yes, it was different to bacterial food borne disease, but this different area I slotted into was a refreshing change, and one which I found satisfying, to an extent I didn’t expect.The next exciting period of our growth is consolidating ourselves in the consulting world, while we establish our offerings in research and in education and training.  To this end, as mentioned above, we have made an appointment of someone to lead our education and training area, and are actively looking to fill our newly created leadership positions in research and in consulting and extension.  With these three functional areas capably led, we’ll be able to advance in accordance with our mission toward our vision.  This is indeed a particularly exciting development early in our second year of operation.What kind of advice or insights may I be able to offer or do I have in food microbiology or in establishing an organisation like this?  Here are some that come to mind:There is plenty of opportunity in food quality and spoilage, as the economic impacts are significant.Resist the temptation to have a business plan at the start of your organisation.  Instead, have a framework and a mindset that allows self-reflection and reflection of the organisation so that change to occur as you work flexibly and fluidly towards attaining a minimum viable product or service.It doesn’t hurt to focus on the basis!  Start small (one person!) and concentrate on your expertise/interests.Another temptation to resist is distraction – many of us with an entrepreneurial mind have too many ideas.  Learn which you should pursue and when you should give them up.Know your WHY.  ‘Why’ you are doing what you’re doing is so important, as a business coach told me a few weeks ago.  My ‘why’ is to improve the quality of life of people – through safer food, fresher food and healthier food.  This is why I love my work, because of the difference I make to the quality of life of people in this way through food.Keep trying things, have outlandish ideas and just give them a go.  People are generally not going to make great strides by playing it safe and adopting a risk-free approach.Most of all, you’ve got to love what you’re doing otherwise you won’t want to do it!",
Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality, fungi, yeast",Complexities of shelf-life extension,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/complexities-of-shelf-life-extension/,"January 18, 2021","Food spoilage and the subsequent waste is costly.  The convenience of a long shelf-life benefit all along the supply chain from farm to fork.  Therefore, it is understandable that many start-up food manufacturers undergoing initial, or advanced, prototype development wish to extend the shelf-life of their product, for obvious reasons – today’s post-manufacture supply chains can be long and complex, and expensive too, especially if a cold chain is required.  Thus, achieving a lengthy shelf-life at ambient temperature is many people’s dream!  This also holds true for established food manufacturers, particularly when seeking new, more distant markets (especially in climate locations where temperature control is unreliable) or attempting to become a better proposition for selling in a physical, ‘brick and mortar’ store, where retailers wish to display for as long as possible to avoid price reductions due to food passing its Best Before date, hence cutting into their profit margin.It is not uncommon to look at shelf-life extension or optimisation, largely in terms of the finished product.  What can we do to the food to have it last longer?  Process differently or include preservatives are the two most common thoughts that come to mind when people look at approaches to increase shelf-life, although more brand owners are considering reformulation as a way to lengthen shelf-life.  Ultimately, reformulation should achieve one of two outcomes; I) provide some kind of an antimicrobial substance or II) alter the intrinsic conditions of the food such that the microorganisms cannot grow or grow more slowly.  Natural antimicrobial substances, such as from the inclusion of botanical essential oils (Figure 1) or bacteriocins are examples of such antimicrobial substances that will exert a preservation effect.Figure 1: The four best antibacterial botanic essential oils.If we consider the intrinsic conditions, this is where are really getting back to basics, basic microbial physiology that is learn during introductory microbiology classes … meaning their are factors which govern microbial growth and if these factors cannot be met, the microbes cannot grow, it really is as simple as that.  Examples of such factors are pH and water activity (Figure 2) and in turn, there are various ways to achieve these.  Water activity for example, can be lowered through an increase in salts or sugars.  Really though, the best indicators as to the shelf-life of a food and what is able to spoil it is pH and water activity.  Temperature as an extrinsic factor (Figure 2) can then offer further shelf-life benefits.Figure 2: Some intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors that can influence shelf-life.Water activity is a concept that is sometimes misunderstood, yet plays an absolutely critical role in the shelf-life properties of a product.  So what is water activity?  Is it the same as moisture?  Why is it even important?  Let me delve into these a little – moisture is the water content overall, but within what is considered moisture, there is water bound to food molecules and the like and free water in the food product.  It is this free water, and this free water only, that is available for microbial growth – it is measure on a scale between 0 (minimum) and 1 (maximum) (Figure 3).  Therefore, the concepts of moisture (total water content) and water activity (amount of free water that is able to be used by microorganisms for their growth) are related but different.  While moisture may give an indication of water activity, you cannot be sure, thus it is water activity, which is the definitive measure as to how much water is available in a food product to support growth of microorganisms.Figure 3: Water activity scale.However, if one is really going to optimise shelf-life then a myriad of other factors come into play, right from farm to fork.  While HACCP is the way that food safety risks can be managed and minimised, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) during primary production (Figure 4) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) during manufacture are key elements to ‘squeeze’ every possible amount of shelf-life out of a product.  As a result, shelf-life optimisation needs to be considered in context of the entire agrifood farm to fork supply chain.  There are not a lot of practices that many consider as impactful on shelf-life.  As examples, farm hygiene, manufacturing environment design and airflow are some which might be forgotten as what needs to be considered to optimise one’s product’s shelf-life.  Furthermore, practices of workers is key, as are Standard Operating Practices (SOPs), which may need to be reviewed and updated.Figure 4: Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)Thus, many, many factors come into play when looking extending or optimisation the shelf-life of a food product.  It isn’t as straight-forward as changing processing conditions or adding in some preservatives.  There’s no doubt that it is a complex process requiring painstaking consideration and analysis of primary production, your suppliers, transport, manufacturing environment, personnel, retail conditions and possible temperature and other abuse by consumers during domestic transport and storage.  Therefore, knowing that these factors could be influential isn’t enough to optimise or extend shelf-life, it is vital to know how these factors could come into play in decreasing the shelf-life of your specific product.","food microbiology, food preservation, food spoilage, shelf life"
Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality",Bacterial lipolytic spoilage of bovine milk,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/bacterial-lipolytic-spoilage-of-bovine-milk/,"October 29, 2020","The AIFST, as the professional association for food scientists and food technologists in Australia, has many awards available for its members.  One of these for young members (under 30 years of age) is theJohn Christian Young Food Microbiologist award.  In 2006, a few months before my 30th birthday, I submitted the below 500 word summary of an aspect of my PhD research I was undertaking at the time, as a collaboration between Food Science Australia (CSIRO), The University of Melbourne and The University of Queensland.  By the way, I was not selected as a finalist for this award.Spoilage can occur in milk by a variety of different means.  Pasteurised milk is most often spoiled due to microbial growth whereas enzymatic spoilage predominates in UHT milk.  This is due to the heat treatments applied.  Pasteurisation conditions are typically heating at 72 °C for 15 sec while UHT treatment conditions are approximately 140 °C for 4 sec.  This variation in heat treatment results in a commercially sterile product (UHT milk) and a product in which pathogens have been eliminated but spoilage microbes still exist (pasteurized milk).  As microbes are longer present in UHT milk, spoilage takes place due to other mechanisms.  Lipase is naturally present in raw milk or can also result from bacterial growth.  UHT processing doesn’t inactivate bacterial lipase, the action of which in UHT milk, can result in lipolytic rancidity.  This takes place when the lipase catalyses the reaction resulting in release of a fatty acid from a mono-, di- or triacylglycerol molecule.  Thus, free fatty acids (FFAs) result along with a glycerol molecule (Figure 1).  Combinations of particular FFAs, when present at certain concentrations in UHT milk, can impart characteristic flavours.  These flavours are perceived as off-flavours, and when this has occurred, he product has spoiled and therefore, reached the end of its shelf-life.Figure 1: A cartoon depiction of how the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) can lose its integrity and become susceptible to the action of lipase, releasing free fatty acids (FFAs) from, in this case, a triacylglycerol molecule.The most common methods in use for measurement of FFAs are the extraction-titration techniques (Deeth, 1993).  Examples are the method of Salihet al.(1977) and that described by Deethet al.(1975), which was used in this experiment.  Salihet al.(1977) mentions that recovering a high percentage of hydrophilic short-chain FFAs without extracting other hydrophilic acids can be a problem.  IDF (1991) has compared the percentage recovery of individual FFAs and found that the procedure described by Salihet al.(1977) is superior to the Deethet al.(1975) method in this regard.  Although improved results are expected, the technique is tedious and time-consuming.  This would be a reason to favour the Deethet al.(1975) method over that of Salihet al.(1977). Other methods which have been reported include spectrophometric methods.  For example, those based on the conversion of the FFAs to copper soaps, with subsequent extraction and then reaction with a colorimetric reagent for detection at 440 nm (Shipeet al., 1980).  This method has been modified more recently for detection of FFAs resulting from lipolytic activity of bacteria growing in a model broth system with various lipid sources as lipase substrate (Leuschneret al., 1997).For detailed analysis of the specific FFAs present in milk, gas chromatography (GC) methods are widely used.  These methods can be used for underivatised (de Jong & Badings, 1990; Wijesundera & Drury, 1999; Cardaket al., 2003) or derivatised (Ulberth & Schrammel, 1995; Wikinget al., 2003; Silvaet al., 2005) FFAs, which are usually free fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), although Rosenfeld (2002) discusses various options for derivatisation of FFAs.  A new alternative method unrelated to extraction-titration or GC is based on the use of fourier transform infra red (FT-IR) techniques (Pedersen, 2004).ReferencesCardak, A.D., Yetismeyen, A. & Bruckner, H.

A few weeks ago, I started moving our video content to our new Brand YouTube channel, with the first (and so far the only!) video on our channel being  on my career in food microbiology.  In fact, this video formed the basis of our vlog posted on May 24, which is located here:http://foodmicrobiology.academy/2020/05/24/my-food-microbiology-career/.So anyway, a few days ago my video was found by a (very) young aspiring food microbiologist in Mumbai, India.  This teenage student made some comments to initiate a conversation with my around career advice and guidance, then we continue our discussions through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.  Now, we’re about to formalise our discussions with a mentoring agreement.  This is just great news and of mutual benefit as she can clearly gain from my years on a non-traditional career path and I real feel like I’m ‘giving back’ and encouraging and ‘grooming’ the next generation of passionate food microbiologists to come along and really take on the challenges of the world and solve them, which we can all really achieve together.  This student is pretty amazing because even at her young age, she has a career vision and a firm goal of wanting to work in the area of food safety and foodborne diseases at the World Health Organization.  With such a plan at such an early age, she can so get there as well.  What I wanted this blog post to be was to introduce the career mentoring thatFood Microbiology Academynow offers by elaborating on some of the examples I provided to this mentee during our early discussions.Firstly, too many people, myself included years ago in the mid to late 1990s, have a general career idea but no firm goal and vision.  Without this, you do almost wander aimlessly to some extent.  Thus, I would say – don’t worry about or try and identify what you will study as your undergraduate degree and where until you have identified your dream job.  Then, you can work backwards.  Setting your dream job as your goal will help answer so many questions, such as:Which is the highest degree I’ll need?Do I need to do a Master degree?  if so, should it be a research or coursework Master degree?Which country should I complete my various degrees in?What should my undergraduate degree be in?What sort of opportunities should I seek during holidays or internships to support me reaching my career goal(s)?For example, if you have come to the conclusion that you need a PhD, does the Australian (three years, one laboratory, research only) or North American (four years, laboratory rotations during the first year, 25% coursework) model work better for you and your career.  Then, for training like a PhD, the importance of factors that you should consider can be ranked like this, from most important to least important: Supervisor > Laboratory > Department > University > Country.  Some people get to hung up over doing their PhD in a particular country or a particular university.  However, it is the supervisor that is most critical and I’m sure you can find exceptional academic supervisors leading world-class research groups engaging in cutting edge discoveries located in what many would consider sub-standard universities or lower ranking countries for research training or higher education in general.However, you may not even be at the stage where you can identify your ideal or dream job, but you just have a hankering for food microbiology.  In such case, perhaps consider the following, as a non-exhaustive list of careers in food microbiology that require high levels of responsibility, so senior positions that typical require a PhD:I)Teaching food microbiology in a college/university(professor in a community college).II)Doing food safety research in a university(research-only academic position, like Research Assistant Professor or Senior Research Fellow, in a research-intensive university).III)Teaching food microbiology and doing food safety research in a university(traditional academic position).IV)Doing food safety research and development in a food manufacturing company(only food manufacturing companies of substantial size, like Nestlé would engage in such R&D)V)Consulting and therefore providing advice to small and medium size food companies on keeping their products safe(either as an independent consultant or working for a scientific consulting firm).VI)Managing food safety at a large food manufacturing company(this may be part of a quality management role of if the food manufacturing operation is large enough, then it would be a seperate position).VII)Tracking foodborne diseases and identifying sources of outbreaks(such as at a government health organisation, which could be at a national level like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States or the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory in the Australian state of Victoria)VIII)Developing public health strategies and government policy to reduce foodborne disease(an advisory role in government to assemble scientific information and make recommendations for policy and legislative changes to protect the health of the citizens under the jurisdiction of the government you’re working for).So, if you’re a budding food microbiologist (no pun intended!) or simply want to find out more about careers and working in our field, do contact myself (Dr Philip Button, @pdbutton, by e-mail to philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academy).","career, career choice, food microbiologist, mentoring"
Food quality,food-quality,Food technology neophobia,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-technology-neophobia/,"August 9, 2020","Neophobia has been defined as an “irrational fear” (Figure 1) and that is certainly true.  The concept of food neophobia is certainly not new.  However, the area and indeed concept of foodtechnologyneophobia is a relatively new idea.  Perhaps I should refine that somewhat and say that food technology neophobia is not new, but recognition of it to the point where it has been named, is new.  The importance of food technology neophobia prompted Cox and Evans (2008) to develop a psychometric scale in the mid-2000s to assesses such consumer concerns.  This scale has been validated by Verneauetal. (2014) has been applied to assess degree of concern and resistance to various agrifood technologies by consumers, such as by Vidigalet al.(2015), who found (predictably) that concern was highest for genetic modification in food and agriculture along with applications of nanotechnology.  Furthermore, this scale has been refined, abbreviated and applied to consumers (Schnettleret al., 2016).  The original food technology neophobia scale has also also been demonstrated to be suitable for its intended purpose in a vastly different cultural and society context from which it was developed (De Steuret al., 2015).Figure 1: Definition of neophobia.This increasing prominence of food technology neophobia can be linked to the increasingly rapidity of technological advancements in the last two to three decades (Figure 2) and that food technology neophobia could be seen as something that is holding back progress in society, in the world, and curtailing implementation of scientific and technological advancements.Figure 2: Advancements in food technology over the last 700 000 years.For example in Australia, the federal government approved commercial cultivation of GM canola in 2003 – it was the first GM food to receive approval in Australia after GM cotton has been increasingly grown since 1996.  However, despite this federal approval after a rigorous assessment by the Office of the Gene Tehnology Regulator (OGTR), most states immediately placed moratoria on planting in their respective jurisdictions, with only Queensland and the Northern Territory not.  This no doubt hindered progress in those early years of GM canola growth as the crop was not permitted commercially until 2008, when New South Wales and Victoria lifted their moratoria.  Only last year, did South Australia lift their moratorium on the cultivation of GM canola.  Now, 20% of Australia’s canola crop is genetically modified, bringing great benefits to primary producers.  It has been a long and slow journey to (very) gradually increase the proportion of GM canola over non-GM canola (Figure 3).  One can lament the situation and the negative impact that such moratoria had on society’s progress in Australia.  It took 16 years for GM canola to be permitted to be grown in every state and territory after federal approval to do so I 2003, but at least it has happened now and the wheels of advancement in that area are moving again.Figure 3: Increase in GM canola between 2009 and 2014 in Australia.While I have detailed the situation with GM canola here, the same neophobic section tends to occur with various food processing technologies, and has been happening for a very long time.  Despite the science supporting the public health benefits of milk pasteurisation, many consumers remained skeptical and indeed opposed to implementation of this life-saving technology.  Today, there is great food technology neophobia associated with food irradiation in particularly.  It is safe and effective (Figure 4), and the science continues to demonstrate that, but consumer resistance prevents its wide scale adoption.Figure 4: Food irradiation is a safe method of preserving food.There is little doubt that the world could be in a far better place now if science and technology was allow to progress and advance society without hindrance from people’s, largely irrational, fears.  There is certainly a major trust issue involved in this aspect, yet there is some contradiction.  Let me explain – one result from a study (Figure 5) that I was involved in that was published in 2013 (Chanet al., 2013) was that people trust scientists (and their family GP) most when it comes to product information about food.  Presumably this is because consumers see scientists and their family GP as having no conflict of interest.  In general though, GPs and scientists are the two most trusted professions in Australia (Figure 6).Figure 5: Consumer trust of food product information and its sources, a joint study by RMIT University and GS1 Australia.Figure 6: Trust of professions in Australia.As one may expect, food manufacturers were considered to be the least trustworthy.  So, based on this, consumers should presumably be open to listening to scientists sharing with them about the science of a particular scientific innovation and how/what the practical applications of that technology are, or can be.  However, this doesn’t always seem to be the case.  People still tend to be suspicious, of the technology.  Is this because there is interference from government and/or food manufacturers? Or contribution to the argument from some minor advocacy groups?  Perhaps both of these are true.  Or is that scientists just can’t communicate in an effective, impactful and persuasive manner?  Meaning, they simply can’t sell their results and ideas are scientific safety.  One aspect is certain though, the science is strong and robust and it is being communicated to consumers by impartial scientists that have no link to any organisations with an interest in advancing the technology, yet people are not listening.  Why is that and how real is food technology neophobia?  Most importantly, as scientists, what are the most effective ways we can work with consumers to alleviate their concerns and show them the real benefits of technology innovation and implementation?  This is likely to be a key to advancing society and indeed saving the world as we continue to grow in population, farm marginal lands (Figure 6) and encounter many challenges in public health.Figure 6: How to bring productivity to marginal lands.ReferencesChan, C., Kam, B., Coulthard, D., Pereira, S., & Button, P.

Food quality,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",How to preserve food with ozone,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/how-to-preserve-food-with-ozone/,"July 22, 2020","Heat treatment of food was a marvellous public health revolution.  It enabled safe food to last longer and was an advancement from the early preservation methods of salting, smoking and the like.  Despite the many advantages of thermal treatment of food, there are of course detrimental effects.  For many decades, the advantages of heat preserving food outweighed the disadvantages.  However, in the past 20-30 years, many non-thermal food processing technologies have emerged as commercially viable.  This is despite many of these actually old technologies.  One such technology is ozonation.  Many technological advancements have enabled a wide range of different approaches to food preservation to come to the fore, another important reason is consumer-driven.  That reason is indeed a driver of food trends and the fact that consumers increasingly want minimally processed foods that represent a ‘clean and green’ approach of sourcing and processing.Ozone is another food processing technology that tends to be referred to as ’emerging’ or ‘innovative’ when in fact it is old technology.  It is reported to have been first used for water treatment in 1893, in the Netherlands, and for food (meat) preservation in 1909, in Germany.  Just to be clear at this stage that ozone is a gas, O3, which has one additional oxygen atom compared to molecules of oxygen, O2.What can ozone be used for?It has wide applications in the food industry (Figure 1), and not only in food preservation:Ensuring microbiological safety of foods.Prevention of spoilage and extending shelf-life.Disinfection of water supplies.Sanitisation of surfaces in food manufacturing facilities (Figure 2).Eliminating odours in food.Reducing the residual pesticides remaining on fresh produce.Figure 1: Applications of ozone in the food sector.Figure 2: How ozonated water can be used in food processing plants.What foods can ozone be used with/on?It’s more what foods that ozone is NOT compatible with!  Ozone is very versatile indeed and can be used with these foods or types of products:Fresh or frozen foods.Fruits and vegetables.Red meat, poultry and seafood.Dairy foods.Spices.Beverages.Nuts.How is ozone formed?For ozone to form, air or ideally pure oxygen (for a higher yield when actually generating ozone) is necessary as the starting point (Figure 3) (Step 1).  Energy is then required to split the oxygen molecule into individual atoms.  This energy more often comes in the form of a corona discharge (Step 2).  Once oxygen atoms are available, they are free to bond with any oxygen molecules that have not split, which forms ozone (Step 3).  During its action, one of the oxygen atoms from the ozone molecule splits off  (Step 4) and you have an oxygen molecule remaining (Step 5).  This is another big advantage of this technology, no toxic/harmful end products, just simple and human-life-sustaining oxygen molecules.Figure 3: Formation of ozone.How is ozone generated?The above paragraph outlines about how ozone is actually formed, but how about its actual commercial generation?  As mentioned previously generation using energy from corona discharge is more common, as can be seen in Figure 4.  At the start of the process we have oxygen molecules entering the system, either as air or pure oxygen.  A fan blows the gas to the part of the unit where the high voltage corona discharge provides energy for disruption of the oxygen molecules to make individual oxygen atoms available.  These oxygen atoms combine with oxygen molecules to form ozone.Figure 4: Corona discharge ozone generation.How can ozone be applied to food, water or surfaces?In either aqueous or gaseous forms.  Where possible, the gaseous form would be preferred due to increased stability of the ozone compared to the aqueous form.  These diagrams show the process of treating food with ozone.  In each case, note that an ozone generator close by the treatment area is mandatory, due to the stability of ozone, even in the gaseous phase.  In Figure 5 we have an example of how ozone can be applied to food when the ozone is diffused in water.  To start the process the oxygen is concentrated before entering the generation unit.  Next is the treatment chamber, where the generated ozone is physically combined with water, by one or two techniques, either venturi injection or fine bubble diffusion.  Due to instability, immediate use of the ozonated water is a must.Figure 5: How ozone is generated and applied in aqueous form.With the application of gaseous ozone to food, Figure 6 shows this process, where you have air or pure oxygen flowing into ozone generation unit, which then enters the treatment chamber for the gaseous treatment of the food.  Now, although ozone degrades to oxygen gas after use, it is very important to be aware that ozone is a harmful gas, as a respiratory irritant at low concentrations or at high concentrations it can be fatal.  Thus, monitoring of the amount of residual ozone remaining after treatment is necessary, then the passage of this output gas through an ozone destructor is required to ensure that no ozone remains and is emitted into the processing environment.Figure 6: How ozone is generated and applied in gaseous form.This is an overview of the technology, what it can be used for and how to use it.",
Food quality,"food-quality, food-safety",Food irradiation is safe!,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-irradiation-is-safe/,"July 13, 2020","Originally written by Jill Koh in April 2010.Second review and minor revisions by Philip Button in July 2020.History of food preservation can be traced back many, many decades ago, with various processing methods such as canning, pasteurisation, and flash freezing. Food irradiation is a newer method of food preservation which is increasingly employed by food manufacturers to complement existing technologies due to the number of beneficial effects on foods (“Food Irradiation,” 1994). The process calls for controlled exposure of foods to a source of ionising radiation energy under specific environmental conditions (usually gamma rays and electron beams – Figure 1) at adequate levels to produce the desired result, yet avoiding degradation of the product (“Food Irradiation,” 1994).Figure 1: Some forms of ionising radiation.A unique advantage of irradiation is its strong penetrative power. Foods can be treated in their final packaging with only a slight increase in temperature, thus avoiding the possibility of recontamination (Henson, 1995). Furthermore, the three forms of radiation (radappertization, radicidation, and radurization, differentiated by radiation dosage) (Figure 2) were found to be effective in enhancing keeping quality of foods, and were quickly adapted by meat manufacturers to eliminateTrichinella spirallisin meat (Henson, 1995).Figure 2: Forms of radiation in the treatment of food.As shown above, the benefits of food irradiation to known causes is established- sterilization and control of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria in foods are the primary objectives; while delay of ripening and sprouting hindrance in fruits and vegetables enable these commodities to have a long shelf-life (“Food Irradiation,” 1994). It was reported that sprouting in root crops can be inhibited at low irradiation doses of 0.05-0.15 kGy (“Food Irradiation,” 1994) (Figure 3). In another study, the use of gamma ray irradiation up to 10 kGy on beef sausage patties reduced bacterial populations with no adverse effect on quality and sensory characteristics (Park, et al., 2010). These had led to a huge leap in quantity of irradiated foods with 405 000 ton produced globally (Kume, Furuta, Todoriki, Uenoyama, & Kobayashi, 2009).Figure 3: Effect of food irradiation treatment of spouting of potatoes during shelf-life.As with all new food processes, food irradiation has generated criticism from health experts due to potential health risks and conflicting evidence on the effects and safety of irradiated foods (Diehl, 2002; Louria, 2000). Acceptance of irradiated foods is not uniform globally; with Japan and United States embracing the technology while progress in the European Union is slow (Diehl, 2002; Kume, et al., 2009). Moreover, the regulation of irradiated foods in different countries are not standardized, hence resulting in difficulty to assess the nutritional content and safety of irradiated food products (Diehl, 2002).  However, as of 2010, food irradiation is approved in over 55 countries (Junqueira-Gonçalveset al., 2011), which is certainly promising for its widespread commercial use.Public opinion on irradiated foods was considered positive during the growth of nuclear technology in 1950 (Diehl, 2002). However, the climate of consumer views changed with the progress of anti-nuclear movement and increased knowledge of health and nutrition (Figure 4). To counteract this phenomenon, a study group on High Dose Irradiation examined the results of safety studies on foods irradiated with doses higher than 10 kGy in 1997 (Diehl, 2002). It was concluded that few foods withstand doses above 10 kGy without sensory quality loss. Also, a study on animals fed with foods irradiated up to 70 kGy showed no adverse health effects. Thus, the study group concluded that foods irradiated to achieve intended technological purposes are both safe and nutritionally satisfactory (Diehl, 2002). In Australia, a study conducted found no significant changes in fatty acid compositions of Black Bream and Redfish after gamma-irradiation treatment of up to three times the recommended dosage, albeit vitamin E loss remained uncertain (Armstrong, Wyllie, & Leach, 1994).Figure 4: Consumers perception of irradiated foods.Despite reassurance on non-toxicity and radioactivity in irradiated foods by governmental and health authorities, major concerns remain on the safety and nutritional adequacy of irradiated foods due to conflicting results and conclusions made by opposing parties (“Food Irradiation,” 1994) (Figure 5). Fears of carcinogenic food from irradiation that leads to DNA damage was suggested in a human study that found chromosomal breaks in malnourished children fed with irradiated wheat (Louria, 2000). The findings were consistent in another experiment when irradiated wheat was fed to monkeys and rats (Tritsch, 2000). In addition, irradiation was found to destroy some vitamins, such as loss of thiamin content in irradiated pork (Louria, 2000); and reduced level of vitamin E in irradiated rolled oats (“Food Irradiation,” 1994). Furthermore, it was reported by Tritsch (2000) that the number of bacteria increased exponentially during cold storage of irradiated fish fillet, implying division of all cells and progeny produced. Bacterial contamination of the fish fillets equaled that of non-irradiated fillets upon additional 14 days of storage. It was also suggested that the new population of bacteria are more radiation resistant than the original population. Lastly, the most radiation-resistant organism,Deinococcus radiouranswas isolated from irradiated canned meat (Tritsch, 2000). These food scares has led to proposition by consumer groups the possibility of food irradiation employment to conceal bad manufacturing practices (Henson, 1995).Figure 5: Some consumers’ perception of irradiated food.As demonstrated above, food irradiation remains a controversial issue with many barriers to overcome before gaining support from consumers and opposition parties for widespread use. To aid this process, (Louria, 2000) has proposed testing of irradiated foods by external parties with full disclosure of results placed on the label of the final product. Another issue to address is the lack of confidence in the process of scientific approval of food irradiation. Although irradiation of meat requires prior approval by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS), consumers are still suspicious of the regulatory process itself due to loss of trust in both the government and administrative agencies (Henson, 1995). A good example is the UK government’s failure to warn consumers of the mycotoxin patulin in fruit juice which heightened consumer suspicions over the motives of food regulators (Henson, 1995). Another alternative is to market irradiated foods at selected consumer groups least sensitive to the technology. A striking observation was that irradiated foods sold very well to consumers who accept food irradiation (Henon, 1995; Henson, 1995). However, the most effective strategy in the long term would be to change consumer perception towards the technology. Existing attempts to promote the benefits of food irradiation have met with limited success due to the absence of solid evidence on the safety of irradiated foods (Henson, 1995). Consequently, it is important for authorities to promote food irradiation based on greater understanding of consumer concerns, social and cultural values to speed up adoption of the technology.References:Armstrong, S.

Food quality,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",Please listen to the scientists!,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/please-listen-to-the-scientists/,"July 3, 2020","What people want drives change.  Throughout history we have seen this and even most recently, or should I say currently, the overwhelming wants of many in society have seen protests and rallies the world over for Black Lives Matter, despite the very real dangers from the surging COVID-19 pandemic.  In just a matter of weeks, this has become a real global movement with rapid change occurring that one would not have thought possible a couple of months ago.  Thus, it is people and society that are drivers of change.  If a voice is loud enough, and/or persistent enough, it will be heard.  I didn’t intend this blog post to be an information piece on sociology, but wanted to highlight how powerful voices can be as drivers of reform, policy change and indeed even ideological foundations.  Therefore, we can see that people are able to lead change and drive change in so many areas.Food is a big one in this regard.  Food is a major part of culture and identity, plus it is an integral part of daily life.  As a result of these reasons, many people tend to have quite strong views or opinions with regard to food.  It is these views or opinions, if held by enough people, can become food trends, drivers of change to the food supply.  So many people are under the misconception that food manufacturers are using processing technologies or ingredients purely for their own benefit and without regard for consumers.  This is not true, and here’s why.  Food manufacturers are dependent on sales of their products for survival of their business.  If they do not take into consideration what consumers want or don’t want, they are then directly harming their business.  Think about it – consumers have a preference, for example, against artificial chemical preservatives in food, but if a food manufacturer loads a food with ten such preservatives to give that food a super/ultra long shelf-life to enable wide distribution to reach distant markets, what will actually happen?  Consumers will avoid that product, sales will drop and that food manufacturer will financially suffer.  It’s pretty clear-cut.  Therefore, it is in the food manufacturer’s best interests to give consumers what they want – such as minimal processing or preservative-free foods, for example.  To be clear about this – it is consumers which drive food trends, with food manufacturers merely responding to these food trends that consumers are creating with their preferences.Ok, so what is actually trending in my expertise area of food preservation?  Consumers are after natural, ‘clean and green’ (Figure 1) and desire quality food.  Food quality is more than non-spoiled food these days.Figure 1: Ways to eat ‘clean’.Quality of food tends to also refer to high in (original) taste along with minimal nutritional deterioration.  These reflect the ‘natural’ aspect of food.  Marry consumers’ interests with the long shelf-life desired by food manufacturers, and you have what might seem an impossible situation … combining a long shelf-life without the traditional approach to food preservation using chemical preservatives.  So how can we do this?  Well, it’s my intention here to just raise the names of the plethora of alternative processing technologies either in use or under various stages of development – such as:High pressure processingPulsed electric fieldIonising radiationOhmic heatingRadio frequencyMicrowavesUltrasoundUltraviolet lightInfrared heatingOzone (Figure 2)Supercritical carbon dioxidePower ultrasoundsCold plasma (Figure 3)Electrolysed waterHigh voltage arc dischargePulsed lightFigure 2: An industrial scale ozone-based fruit disinfection system.Figure 3: Benefits of cold plasma for eliminating fungi and mycotoxins from food.In many, or should I say most, foods to be processed, heat is still the best option.  It could be due to effectiveness in ensuring a safe product or a prolonged shelf-life, financial considerations or consumer perception of the new technology.  One aspect is certain though, there is a desire to move away from thermal processing.  While it has many benefits with regard to its effective elimination or reduction of microorganisms, there are a whole range of detrimental effects of heat on product quality, which consumers are increasing not willing to tolerate.  The tough aspect can be to find an alternative that is I) financially viable for the manufacturer, II) addresses safety requirements set by government authorities, III) enable an appropriately long shelf-life, IV) improves or at least maintains quality (sensory and nutritional) quality of the product and V) is accepted by consumers.  Unfortunately, sometimes the (very) loud voices of a (very) small minority of radical opponents to a new technology drown out the scientists attempting to speak the truth about a new technology.  This can lead to very delayed introduction sometimes of an effective and safe technology.  Such a scenario should not be allowed to stay in the way of the progress of humanity, which unfortunately it has many a time.  Just look at ionising radiation in food preservation, also known as food irradiation or GM foods.  Both are demonstrated to be extremely safe, yet there is strong public opposition (Figure 4) despite benefits for food preservation and wastage (Figure 5) and for the environment (Figure 6).  Opposition based on what? …when the science says it is safe, yet these radical minorities cling to a myth of hope that might come true one day, and devalue the work of the world’s great scientists in essentially endorsing the safety of these technologies.  Come on everyone, keep a level head and please listen to the scientists, for all our sakes!Figure 4: Public perception of the agricultural and food manufacturing industry.Figure 5: Preventing apple spoilage with GM.Figure 6: How GM crops benefits the environment.","food preservation, food science, frankenfood, gm foods, gmo"
Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality",UHT processing and microbial spoilage of UHT milk.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/uht-processing-and-microbial-spoilage-of-uht-milk/,"June 28, 2020","This is an extract from my PhD thesis, passed by The University of Melbourne in 2008.In the early 1950s, experimental UHT processing was underway in the United States (Tobias, 1955), while in Switzerland, UHT-type processing was introduced commercially in 1953 (Zadow, 1993a; 1998).  Once the problem of aseptic filling had been addressed (Zadow, 1975), commercial UHT processing commenced in Australia around 1964 (Zadow, 1993a; 1998).  This followed research and development around the world on aseptic processing since around the 1870s (Hostettler, 1972a).  Two variations of UHT treatment are in use: direct (Figure 1) and indirect (Figure 2).  A detailed description of these two techniques is provided by Dattaet al.(2002) who also cover effects on milk while Jelen (1982) discusses both direct and indirect techniques from various perspectives of industrial relevance.  The basis of the direct heating system is the direct mixing of steam with milk.  This can be achieved in one of two ways: either steam injection, where steam is injected into the milk or steam infusion, in which milk enters an infusion chamber containing superheated steam.  Indirect UHT treatment occurs when milk is heated by contact with steam or superheated water across the metal surface of a heat exchanger.Figure 1: Direct UHT processing.The major difference between the two forms of UHT treatment is the temperature profile during treatment (Figure 3), as outlined by Zadow (1986).  Direct UHT treatment is less severe because an almost instantaneous rise and fall in temperature takes place with the milk held at a temperature between 70 and 80 °C for 70 seconds.  In comparison, the increase and decrease in temperature in milk heated indirectly is considerably more gradual, therefore temperatures are elevated for a longer period, at or above 70 °C for 120 seconds and at or above 100 °C for 70 seconds.  Severity of indirect heating is reflected by the degree of denaturation of whey proteins.Dattaet al.(2002), who reviewed this topic, found substantial quantities of undenatured β-LG remaining in UHT milk that was treated by the direct method compared to the minimal amount typically seen in milk following indirect UHT treatment.  These more recent results were not too different from the work of Zadow (1969) who observed more than twice the amount of β-LG denatured in UHT milk processed indirectly compared to that directly treated.Figure 3: Temperature profile comparison of direct and indirect UHT processing.A myriad of nutritional and organoleptic changes have been observed in milk following UHT processing, some of which are unique to this product (Niroumand, 1977).  Changes to proteins induced by ultra high temperature (UHT) processing can be detrimental to stability of UHT milk products.  This is primarily due to formation of a complex between β-LG and the micelle surface proteins (predominately with κ-CN), in addition to interaction of β-LG with α-LA, which all occur at even moderate temperatures (Fairiseet al., 1999), even as low as 80 ºC (Choet al., 2003).  Pasteurisation (Figure 4) is the most widely used heat processing method for raw milk, leading to reduction in numbers of spoilage bacteria and elimination of pathogenic bacteria.  Higher temperatures (between 135 and 150 °C) can be applied for a (usually) shorter duration (between two and 20 sec) (Ahrné, 1988), for more effective control of bacterial contaminants.  This form of heat processing is ultra high temperature (UHT) treatment which provides a very long shelf life, compared to pasteurised milk, even when stored at ambient temperatures.  Such processing conditions give “commercial sterility”.  This aspect is discussed by Luck (1975) and Zadow (1980) and implies that, theoretically, all microorganisms have been eliminated, but in practice this is not attainable and therefore commercial sterility is a measure of the failure rate (Dentener, 1986).  Dentener (1986) also explains that processors usually strive for failure rate of no more than one in 5000.Figure 4: Comparison of heat treamtne to milk by pasteurisation and UHT processing.Mesophilic, psychrotrophic and psychrophilic microorganisms (Figure 5) are usually eliminated during UHT treatment; heat resistance enabling survival of these microorganisms is extremely unusual.  However, spoilage is possible through the presence of mesophilic organisms in the finished product, which can also occur through contamination of the sterile product during filling  For example, there is an isolated report of UHT milk spoilage due to growth ofEnterobactersp. andMicrococcussp., which demonstrated remarkably high levels of heat resistance (Antoine & Donawa, 1990).  It is possible that in this particular case time/temperature combination typical of the UHT process was not achieved.  In some countries, contamination of UHT milk does appear to be a major problem.  For example, in Egypt, some samples of UHT milk had a total bacterial count of up to 105cfu/mL (El-Samragyet al., 1992).Figure 5: Microbial growth temperatures.Due to the heat treatment conditions typical of UHT processing, thermophilic and thermoduric microflora or their spores are most often responsible for contamination of UHT milk (Foschinoet al., 1990; Lewis, 1999).  Although these bacteria are present in freshly drawn raw milk in low numbers (Flintet al., 2001), they may be present in long-life dairy products (Westhoff & Dougherty, 1981), and are very important owing to their potential involvement in spoilage of those products, which has been recognised for a long time (Grinstead & Clegg, 1955).Bacillus sporothermoduranshas been one of the most frequently implicated (Klijnet al., 1997).  As a result of the extreme heat resistance of its spores (Huemeret al., 1998), which may lead to the possibility of spore survival during UHT processing and subsequent germination in UHT milk (Petterssonet al., 1996), it can be regarded as one of the most important.  Also, high levels ofGeobacillus stearothermophilusvegetative cells (Figure 6) may cause flat sour spoilage (Figure 7) of low-acid foods, including milk (Ito, 1981), especially evaporated milk (Kalogridou-Vassiliadouet al., 1989).  It is not unreasonable to expect one in 100 000 1 L packs of UHT milk to be contaminated with thermophilic or thermoduric bacteria, which is considered acceptable (Luck, 1975), although a total count of 102cfu/mL after 15 d at 30 ºC also seems to be acceptable for UHT milk (Lewis, 1999), which would appear odd as this does seem significant contamination.  Although many factors can be influential, the single most important factor in ensuring commercial sterility is a strict maintenance schedule (Farahnik, 1982).Source: https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/874030/view/geobacillus-stearothermophilus-semFigure 6: Transmission electron micrograph ofGeobacillus stearothermophilus.Figure 7: Definition of flat sour spoilage.

Food quality,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",Safety of sodium benzoate (E211),https://foodmicrobiology.academy/safety-of-sodium-benzoate-e211/,"June 15, 2020","Originally written byJill Kohin 2010.  Reviewed, revised and updated byPhilip Buttonin 2020.Sodium benzoate has sparked public health concern due to the discovery of the carcinogenic chemical benzene (Figure 1) in soft drinks (Food and Drug Administration, 2007; Food Standards Agency, 2006). Benzene is a known carcinogen “by all routes of exposure” (Ibolyaet al., 2012) and is present in the atmosphere from exhaust emissions (220 μg) and cigarette smoke (7900 μg) (Figure 2). Benzene levels have only been regulated in drinking water with an upper limit of 5 ppb in the USA (Food and Drug Administration, 2007), or 10 μg/kg in UK (Food Standards Agency, 2006). An early study in 1993 reported that formation of benzene in soft drinks is attributed to the decarboxylation of benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid and transition metals naturally occurring in water (Gardner & Lawrence, 1993). In addition, elevated temperatures and light can stimulate benzene formation under the conditions above which render soft drinks to be a significant source of benzene (Food and Drug Administration, 2007).Figure 1: Benzene is carcinogenic.Figure 2: There are various sources of benzene exposure in everyday activities.The FDA has since initiated a survey on benzene levels in soft drinks and other beverages and found 9 out of 200 beverage products with benzene levels above 5 ppb. The respective manufacturers voluntarily reformulated the products and recent testing reported benzene levels in these products were less than 1.5 ppb. On the other hand, the FDA also conducted tests on 150 drinks with 4 products containing benzene levels above the allowed 10 μg/kg limit.  As such, all 4 products were recalled from the market. In its latest update the FDA has assured the public that it is working closely with the beverage industry to ensure benzene levels are minimized or eliminated where possible.  One way this could be achieved, while prolonging shelf-life at the same time, is through use of the natural additives nisin and natamycin (Garavagliaet al., 2019) which reduced microbial counts and reduced the formation of benzene.  The FDA has also reassured the public that sodium benzoate is still a safe preservative at a daily intake of <0.5g. This is because the body excretes benzoic acid in the urine as hippuric acid (Figure 3), leaving no accumulation of benzoic acid in the body (Belitz, Grosch, & Schieberle, 2009).Figure 3: Conversion of benzoic acid into hippuric acid.Another health concern related to sodium benzoate is the potential effect of causing hyperactivity in children. McCann et al. (2007) conducted an experiment to study the effects of artificial food colour and additives on childhood behaviour and concluded that consumption of foods with sodium benzoate or in combination with artificial colours resulted in increased hyperactivity in 3 year old and 8/9 year old children. However, the results were criticized by other professionals as inconclusive because there were observation of high sensitivity of the food additives in some hyperactive children, while others were unresponsive to the additives (Eigenmann & Haenggeli, 2007). In addition, another study reported that exposure to food additives such as sodium benzoate in children and teenagers rarely reach levels that link food additives and hyperactivity (Connolly, et al., 2010). Hence, further research is needed to establish the link between food additives and hyperactivity in adolescents due to conflicting results shown above.Based on the evidences outlined above, further investigation needs to be carried out to ascertain the side effects of sodium benzoate on human health as results from studies remain inconclusive. However, the food industry is aware of growing consumer concerns on the usage of chemical processing aids in food products and is seeking potential alternatives. One such effort is the development of mathematical models describing growth/no growth boundaries of a highly resistant food spoilage yeast-Z. bailiito aid formulation of shelf-stable foods without inclusion of chemical preservatives (Dang, et al., 2010).The benefits of sodium benzoate as a preservative cannot be denied and have been successfully used in various food applications. Sodium benzoate, on its own, has not been found to have any adverse effect on human health when consumed at maximum level of 4 g/day. Therefore, until concrete results on negative effects on human health have been established, concerned consumers may avoid intake of sodium benzoate by eliminating foods containing the chemical from their diet.  However, considering the facts about sodium benzoate (Figure 4) and the very low chance of exposure benzene from food compared with other sources, elimination of sodium benzoate from the diet is not recommended.Figure 4: Summary of facts about sodium benzoate.ReferencesBelitz, H.

Food quality,"food-quality, food-safety, fungi",Spoiled retail chicken.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/spoiled-retail-chicken/,"May 27, 2020","Woolworths responds after shopper’s ‘absolutely disgusting’ find in chicken — 7NEWS.com.auAs a food microbiologist specialising in food safety, food spoilage, food quality and food preservation, this recent news report (link above) from earlier this month was of particular interest to me.  First of all, I want to provide a response to four particular parts of that news story, then give a general commentary from my perspective.Posting photos appearing to show the mould spots to Facebook, James says he was lucky to spot the problem with the chicken – which was still well within the “best before” period – before eating it.Initially when I saw this reference to a “Best Before” date, I assumed the consumer had got expiry dates mixed up and he actually meant “Use By”, because I understand there is still a great degree of confusion amongst consumers regarding expiry dates on food.  So, in any case, this news story has a photo of the chicken packet and indeed, the expiry date is “Best Before”.  This leads me to ask, why is it a “Best Before” date and not a “Use By” date?  There are major differences between these two expiry dates with “Best Before” dates referring to product quality as impacted by food spoilage while “Use By” dates refer to product safety (Figure 1).  A product has its best quality guaranteed up to the “Best Before” date, after which date it is still safe to consume, but there may be some quality deviation from what consumers expect.  For example in colour or texture.  However,  “Use By’ dates refer to food safety considerations.  After the “Use By” date, food should not be consumed as its safety is not guaranteed.  Chicken is one of the foods, maybe the number food, that has the highest contamination potential from a food safety perspective.  Campylobacter and Salmonella are often seen in the top two microorganisms responsible for foodborne disease, in many countries … and which food(s) are typically vehicles of transmission?  Poultry and poultry products.  Thus, chicken is very much a potential food safety hazard, and it should have a “Use By” date rather than a “Best Before date”.Figure 1: The difference between Use By and Best Before.2.“The mould has been growing for at least a couple of days and it still had two days until the expiry date!I’m sorry, but is this guy a mycologist or a general microbiologist?  How does he know it had been growing for “at least a couple of days” when the product was stored at refrigeration temperature?  I can tell you, if mould spores germinated at refrigeration temperature, you certainly would not see any visible (not to the naked human eye anyway!) growth.  After two days, growth would still be microscopic.  It just amuses me when someone from the general public, who doesn’t know bacteria from mould and thinks you can get sick from growth of food spoilage microorganisms, makes comments like this.3. “Maybe the product was not handled or stored properly (not refrigerated correctly either during transport or once arriving to the store maybe?) which caused the bacteria/mould to grow, which again means the product should not have been sold.This is what I mean where he doesn’t know whether he has seen bacterial growth or mould growth.  Then, trying to identify where in the supply chain the cold chain was broken.  Just stick to the facts and not dramatise it all and don’t try to point fingers when you don’t know where to point them.4.“If myself and my family had eaten this we could have gotten very sick, and that is not good enough. We expect better.”…and here, I leave the best one until last!  He thinks they could have become sick from consuming some (minor) spoiled food.  If it is common for the general public to think that they can become sick from eating spoiled food, then we have a big issue on our hands of trying to bust some pretty big myths.  For the record, let it be known that spoiled food is generally speaking, safe to eat – I have no problem with eating a small amount of mouldy food for example.  While it might be safe to eat, the main issue will be based on quality, as the food may be unpalatable.  Just think, if foodborne disease was caused by spoiled food, then foodborne disease would rarely occur, right?  However it doesn’t.  Foodborne disease is caused pathogenic microorganisms that have grown in or on a food without causing detectable changes to the food.  This is why and how it is so easy to come down with a foodborne disease, because we just don’t know when we might consume an infectious dose of pathogenic microorganisms!Overall, I think this has just highlighted the degree of scientific literacy in Australian society.  Clearly, as food science professionals, we have some work to do in the area of public awareness.  One undervalued area in food science and technology is its crossover with supply chain management and logistics.  Many people I feel, just cannot appreciate the complexities of modern agrifood supply chains (Figure 2).  People at each and every step of the often long and involved agrifood supply chain for a given product are doing there best, and unfortunately, once in a blue moon, a mishap occurs.  Now, that is no reason to ‘crucify’ someone over this.  This is especially so when one consider the impeccable food safety and food spoilage record of primary producers, logistics and retailers and that spoilage of food and safety breaches are more likely to occur in the domestic environment, yes, carelessness in our homes is more likely to result in spoiled food, wasted food and foodborne disease due to cross-contamination and temperature control.Figure 2: An example agrifood supply chain.","chicken, consumers, food microbiology, food spoilage, retail"
Food quality,"bacteria, food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",My food microbiology career,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/my-food-microbiology-career/,"May 24, 2020","Here I venture into a combination approach, with traditional text and video in this first vlog post, covering my career as a food microbiologist.I’m doing a bit of a focus on careers in food microbiology, with my last blog article on this topic and now this one, where I combining the written blog approach with the vlog approach.  My previous blog post introduced the prominence and significance of microbiologists in the world, and thus as a career, before a short description of the areas of food safety, food spoilage/quality and gut health/probiotics and fermented foods.  I then detailed a career Q&A with a food safety auditor from Taipei.  In this video, I ask myself the same questions and show the path I’ve taken to become a food microbiologist.What I didn’t mention is that in 1994, while I was starting my Bachelor degree-level training in biology at Deakin University, I completed a vocational certificate-level course in horticulture, at the then Townsville College of TAFE.  So I’m a qualified horticulturist as well!However, I started as a microbiologist, with my initial training in that area being clinical microbiology with a veterinary emphasis before I gravitated to the wonders of food microbiology in the 3rd-year of my undergraduate degree at James Cook University.  I then continued in food microbiology – working on inducible acid tolerance of foodborne disease bacteria (in salad dressing and yogurt) for my Honours research at the then University of Ballarat, bacterial iron acquisition systems which enable them to spoil refrigerated pork exported to Asian markets for my MSc research at La Trobe University and for my PhD at The University of Melbourne and CSIRO, I investigated aspects of dairy product quality.  Specifically, I characterised the spoilage process of UHT milk with regard to the free amino acids and peptides that are liberated along with free fatty acids, as a result of the residual proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes that remain in the product following UHT treatment (2-4 seconds and around 140 degrees C).  I refined existing protease assays, increasing their sensitivity such that they could be used to better predict the onset of enzymatic-based spoilage in UHT milk.  Essentially therefore, my PhD project was in the area of biochemistry, specifically in enzymology and protein chemistry.For my postdoctoral work, I went to RMIT University where I worked in the Kasapis laboratory, gaining valuable research understanding and technical technical skills in the broad areas of physical chemistry and materials science, especially in relation to the use of carbohydrate polymers and protein in food systems and understanding how application of physical parameters may alter their molecular properties, thus altering their texture, mouthfeel and how they behave as ingredients in food products.  I was primarily using techniques of rheology and (differential scanning) calorimetry.  Following my postdoctoral position, I moved within RMIT University from what was then the School of Applied Sciences to the School of Business IT and Logistics where I contributed to projects in food composition databases, e-commerce and related areas of improving the consumer customer through innovative retailing solutions.Now, as an independent and freelance food microbiologist, I operate my own non-affiliated organisation called Food Microbiology Academy.  I offer services in consulting to the food manufacturing industry worldwide (both to start-ups and established food manufacturing enterprises), academic support (tutoring, research services, teaching) as well as contract and collaborative research – all of these primarily in my core expertise areas of food safety, food spoilage, food preservation and shelf-life extension.","career choice, food microbiologist, food microbiology, food science"

Therefore, there’s no doubt that microbiologists are particularly valuable at the moment.  Especially virologists and those microbiologists that have an understanding of infectious diseases, public health and/or epidemiology.  Plus, some knowledge of immunology can be helpful to for vaccine development as can pharmacology for drug development.  However, it’s really the microbiologists that are coming to the fore.  People talk about ‘saving the world’ and about the impact and importance of careers, but microbiologists really can save the world.  If you had any doubt about the importance of a career in microbiology, then just consider what is happening in the world now and what has happened since December.  …and we’re not just talking about personal and public health, but livelihoods and the global economy.  The economy has gone ‘pear-shaped’ because of a microbiological phenomenon, something that could be stopped by microbiologists, if they are, or were given the opportunity.  The power is in the hands of microbiologists and those with an intricate understanding of microbiology, to save the world, I have no doubt about that.  So, if you want a powerful career, an impactful career, a highly significant career, then consider microbiology!A FOOD MICROBIOLOGY CAREERHow about a career in food microbiology?  What might that look like and what might one be involved with?  Well even in food microbiology there are many varied areas to work in.  The three key areas are: i) food safety, ii) food spoilage/food quality and iii) fermented foods, probiotics and gut health.  Each of these has highly significant impacts on society and on the economy.  Let’s look at each of these in more detail.What is food safety?Food safety is all about ensuring the safety of the food supply.  This means monitoring, auditing, regulating and developing policy for the purposes of safeguarding raw materials and manufactured food over the entire agrifood supply chain from ‘farm to fork’ or ‘paddock to plate’ as the concept goes.  Food safety microbiologists closely associate with epidemiologists, public health professionals and infectious disease experts to combat prevention, tracking and limiting the spread of foodborne diseases of epidemic proportions.What is food spoilage and food quality?Spoilage and subsequent wastage of food results in substantial economic losses.  In countries with developing economies, such spoilage and waste of food is more likely to be fresh produce and thus postharvest and pre-manufacure losses.  In countries with advanced economies, the situation is quite different, with substantial spoilage and waste taking place at the consumer level.  Tight supply chains along with excellent mechanisms of food preservation mean that spoilage losses in such countries are at a minimum.What are fermented foods, probiotics and gut health?This area is closely linked with personal health and wellness.  There is a sustained food trend in the area of probiotics as functional foods, along with prebiotics and people realise the great benefits of how one’s gut health contributes to overall health and wellbeing.  Related to this are fermented foods, many of which are probiotic, and as such, are rich natural sources of ‘good’ bacteria.CAREER PROFILE OF A FOOD MICROBIOLOGISTWondering how a career in food microbiology might actually look like in reality?  Well, I had a Q & A session with Lucy Lam, a food safety auditor from Taipei, Taiwan.  Let’s find out what Lucy’s food microbiology career looks like…What qualification(s) do you hold and from where?Master of Science, with a major in food, nutrition and technology, from The Chinese University of Hong KongBachelor of Food Science, from The University of MelbourneYour present position and where?Auditor, Bureau Veritas Certification  (Taiwan)How would you describe your career ‘in a nutshell’?A passion for food safety and quality control along with being good at problem solving. 1.

Before and after the audit, preparation of the report document is needed.How do you gain most satisfaction in your food microbiology career?When I gained the most hands-on experience in food microbiology when I was working in the food industry between 2013 – 2018. As I was a laboratory supervisor and department assistant manager, I had to oversee the operation of the laboratory including lab supplies, SOPs, good laboratory practices and third party laboratory compliances.What can you forsee as big challenges in your particular area of food microbiology?Food microbiology testing can be regarded as a quality control gate for product release and assurance in food industry. Hence the testing lead time will be demanding and tends to be “quick and accurate”. It is believed that rapid test kits or rapid test methods will be upcoming trends in food microbiology testing.Some advice about a career in food microbiology?It is suggested people who wish to be a food microbiologist must have basic food knowledge, and willing to do a lot of research and study.So there you have it, whether it’s building the health of individuals through improving gut health, ensuring public health is maintained through a safe food supply or curbing the substantial economic losses through food spoilage and food waste, there are multiple ways to save the world as a food microbiologist!

Food quality,food-quality,Use of sodium benzoate (E211) in food preservation,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/use-of-sodium-benzoate-e211-in-food-preservation/,"May 9, 2020","By: Jill Koh & Philip ButtonThis is the first part of a two part series on sodium benzoate.  Both were written by an 4th-year Honours student (who completed the program with 1st class Honours, H1) I was supervising at RMIT University in 2010.  I have revised and updated were necessary and appropriate.Food additives are commonly found in processed foods which are used to facilitate or complement a variety of production methods in today’s modern food supply. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a food additive is defined as “any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result- directly or indirectly, in its becoming a component of or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any food”. Food additives carry out three basic functions (Figure 1): I) to maintain food safety, spoilage and quality by preventing microbial growth or chemical changes, II) improve or maintain nutritional value and III) improve taste, texture and appearance (Emerton & Choi, 2008; Food and Drug Administration, 2007).Figure 1: Reasons consumers want preservatives added to food.Preservatives are considered one of the most important classes of food additives as they play an important role in safety of the food supply. Preservatives are added to foods because elimination of potential microbial contamination through physical methods is not viable (de Mendonça, Vaz, & de Mendonça, 2001). Employment of chemical preservatives such as salt (Figure 2), spices and sulphite have been age-old practices to preserve perishable foods before the advent of refrigeration and processing techniques (Emerton & Choi, 2008) which are able to extend the shelf-life of (primarily) perishable food. Food preservatives extend the shelf-life of foods with their antimicrobial activity to prevent food poisoning (Food and Drug Administration, 2007; Mc Williams, 2008). Hence, they offer consumers the benefit of keeping food safe over the shelf-life of the product to meet the demands of modern lifestyles.Figure 2: Preservation of whole fish with salt.Sodium benzoate, which is food additive E211, is a salt of benzoic acid commonly used for preservation purposes in a wide range of foods such as margarine, salad dressings, sauces and especially carbonated beverages/juices (Figure 3) although it is also naturally found in some fruits such as cranberries and prunes (Food and Drug Administration, 2007; International Programme on Chemical Safety; Jay, 2000). Listed as a GRAS (Generally Recognised as Safe) chemical, sodium benzoate is produced by neutralisation of benzoic acid with sodium hydroxide (Figure 4) and effectively inhibits yeasts and mould growth (International Programme on Chemical Safety; Jay, 2000; Krebs, Wiggins, & Stubbs, 1983). Sodium benzoate is usually preferred by food manufacturers due to its high solubility in aqueous solutions (200 times more soluble) as opposed to benzoic acid (Gardner & Lawrence, 1993; International Programme on Chemical Safety). However, due to the distinctive off-flavour imparted to foods at high concentrations, sodium benzoate has a maximum tolerance level of 0.1% in the US (de Mendonça, et al., 2001; International Programme on Chemical Safety; Jay, 2000), although the World Health Orgnization has stipulated a maximum limit of 0.2% (Wibbertmannet al., 2000).Figure 3: Sodium benzoate is common found as a preservative in carbonated beverages and juices.Figure 4: The chemistry of producing sodium benzoate from benzoic acid through addition of sodium hydroxide.The antimicrobial activity of sodium benzoate is related to environmental pH, displaying greatest activity at low pH values. Extensive literature work has revealed effectiveness of sodium benzoate against a range of food spoilage yeasts such asS.cerevisiae,Z.rouxii, andY.lipolytica(Praphailong & Fleet, 1997). Guynot et al. (2005) has also reported efficacy of sodium benzoate in preventingAspergillus spp.andPenicillium corylophilumspoilage in bakery products at low awlevels. The mechanism of antimicrobial action of sodium benzoate was reported by Jay (2000), Hazan et al. (2004) and Krebs et al. (1983) – under acidic conditions, the undissociated form of sodium benzoate enters the cell and acts as a proton ionophore by facilitating proton leakage into cells. Intracellular acidification of cells inhibit cellular uptake of substrate molecules (such as amino acid transport), resulting in oxidative stress and autophagy, hence inhibiting cell growth.This offers an introduction to chemical food preservatives and in particular, the uses and mechanism of action of this common additive.  In the second blog post in this series, we shall explore the safety of sodium benzoate.References:de Mendonça, A. J. G., Vaz, M. I. P. M., & de Mendonça, D. I. M. D. (2001).

We’ve teamed up to share our understanding of the food product development process to assist accomplished home cooks, home cooks that have an idea that they may want to pursue commercialisation of a much-loved home cooked dish.  Dr Timilsena has contributed the section on the practice of food product development, whereas I have written on the principles of food product development.Figure 1: The front cover of my forthcoming book.For an insight into our soon to be released forthcoming joint publication, I’ve provided the below text below, which is an extract from the book.  Specifically, it is from section 3.3 “Shelf-life and food spoilage” within the third chapter, titled “Design and development”.

It’s of biological origin and is produced in the agricultural environment. Therefore, the presence of microorganisms on and sometimes in the raw material, along with the finished food product, is unavoidable.  Of course there are many instances of product contamination that are avoidable.  Biofilms on processing equipment, non-aseptic filling and poor hygiene practices of food processing line workers are instances of avoidable contamination. When one considers potential for microbial contamination, there are vast differences between commodities, with each type of raw material and finished product having its own characteristic microflora and spoilage, as well as safety considerations. This reflects the natural flora of the primary production environment and of the prevailing conditions within the food, the conditions which can dictate growth and hence the type of microorganisms that grow there. Shelf-life, what limits it and how best to extend it, is a complex process in which many factors come into play. Each factor needs to be considered individually, then in concert with one another, and not just at a single point in time, but how these factors play out along the usually complex agrifood supply chain with the dynamic microbial communities present.It’s important to reach a stage of relative satisfaction with regard to a so-called ‘base’ formulation for your product. A formulation that one could make subtle changes to or tweak, in response to what shelf-life investigations might reveal. With the intended supply chain in mind, and the base formulation in place, shelf-life trials can commence. Of course, the best way to approach this is to simulate shelf-life, and indeed this is the most obvious, simplest and the one which would yield the most precise results. However, in the case of long shelf-life products, and we’re talking about products with a shelf-life as long as one or two years here, the conduct of a shelf-life trial for two years may be impractical. Under such circumstances, accelerated shelf-life trials or predictive modelling can be undertaken, and there are various research papers in the scientific literature describing mathematical modelling of the growth of various microorganisms from a spoilage or safety consideration.To know where to start extending shelf-life, it is important to know some basic facts – such as the current shelf-life, the preservation approaches currently employed, what limits shelf-life, length of the current and anticipated supply chain and the expected environmental conditions experienced, along with the microbiological quality of the raw materials and the processing environment. This information, coupled with an understanding of the typical spoilage or pathogenic microorganisms associated with that food, will give an excellent indication as to how shelf-life can be extended. There are many ways to extend shelf-life – chemical preservatives, traditional processes such as heat and a myriad of new and emerging non-thermal methods of food preservation, among others. Some are better suited to certain food types, certain microorganisms or may have other constraints related to the supply chain or economic considerations.","food microbiology, food product development, food science, food spoilage, product development"
Food quality,"fermented-foods, food-quality",Food safety versus food quality … and expiry dates.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-safety-versus-food-quality-and-expiry-dates/,"January 19, 2020","Ok, well, a concept or maybe it’s just a definition, depending on how you look at it, that is of central importance, not only to food microbiology, but also to food science in general isfood safetyversusfood quality.  I say food science in general, because while to many, I believe, the (micro)biological aspects of food safety and food quality come to mind first, there are indeed many other facets to food safety and food quality.  It’s worth pointing out at this stage that food safety and food quality refers to the unintentional adulteration of food, as can be seen in the image above.  Food fraud and food defence are related concepts, but refer to intentional adulteration of food, of a criminal nature.Briefly then, to start with, what is food safety and what is food quality.  Food safety is a broad term in food science that certainly covers microbiological hazards first and foremost – bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoan and animal parasites, like helminth worms.  However, food safety includes non-biological hazards too (Figure 1).  These are either chemical hazards (for example; antibiotic residues, allergens, pesticide residues, residual cleaning chemicals) and physical hazards like glass, metal, wood and the like that might find their way into food and pose a hazard.  Then there is an interesting crossover area that is usually considered as a biological hazard, because of their biological origin, but it could also be though of as a chemical hazard – toxins produced by fungi or marine animals that find their way into food.Figure 1: An overview of potential hazards in food service operations ppt – Pizza &coFood quality, what is that?  What is quality food?  This is a pretty big question and one that has many perspectives, of which biological is just one.  In food microbiology, food quality is linked to the concept of food spoilage.  Spoiled food, commonly said to be “off”, is food that is no longer thought of as being fit, or maybe I should simply say “pleasant” for human consumption due to the proliferation of microbial growth that has altered the expected sensory expectations of that food.  Think mouldy bread (Figure 2), or ‘lumpy’ pasteurised milk (Figure 3) – these would be regarded as ‘off’, and are considered unpleasant to eat due to our expectation of what the microbiological quality, or status, of that product should be.  I’ll get on to this point again later, but there is a distinction between “fit” for consumption and “pleasant” for consumption.  Fit would be considered more of a food safety concept whereas pleasantness is more in the realm of food quality.  Now, apart from (micro)biological quality, there are concepts of food quality from other areas in food science.  For example nutritional quality and sensory quality.  Over time, during shelf-life, the nutritional status of a manufactured food product can change, and usually this refers to deterioration of nutritional quality because the nutrients present in the food may not match that stated in the Nutrient Information Panel, and furthermore, bioavailability could be impacted too.  Organoleptic, or sensory quality refers to what we can perceive of the product using our senses.  During storage and distribution of manufactured food, a range of quality issues can be impacted, resulting in a product that doesn’t meet with customers’ expectations for that product.  When this happens, the product can be seen by consumers to be of lower quality as it has deviated from not only their expectations, but what it was originally.  This can signal the end of shelf-life for that food.  This is one of the reasons food additives are used – to meet consumers’ quality expectations in that people expect a consistent product, from inconsistent raw biological materials with natural and normal biological variation.  Possibly an unrealistic expectation?  Either way, that’s life in countries considered to have advanced economies.Figure 2: Mould on bread (https://www.slideserve.com/tareq/bread-mold)Figure 3: Lumpy “off” milk (https://www.shared.com/sour-milk-healthier/)With the above information in mind, let us consider an important concept, a concept I consider one of the most important in the distinction between microbiological food safety and food quality.  I’m sure there are exceptions, but I’m not aware of them:Spoiled or “off” food does not make you ill.Foodborne disease originates from food that looks, tastes and smells perfectly normal and thus acceptable to the consumer.This leads me to a discussion of expiry dates, the two most common of which are “use by” and “best before” (Figure 4).  The Use By date is for food safety, and means that the manufacturer does not guarantee the safety of that food beyond that date, although it may (and almost certainly will) look, taste and smell unchanged from the original.  This is because the microorganisms that cause food borne disease are generally present in small amounts in a food and relatively few of them are required for us to get sick.  A Use By date tends to be used for perishable food products, meat and milk for example.  The Best Before date is for food quality, and means that the manufacturer does not guarantee the quality of that food beyond that date.  This means that, for example: the colour may have faded or become more intense; a crunchy product may have softened or a soft product may have become firm or crunchy; or chemical reactions may have taken place in the food which has lowered its nutritional quality.  Best before dates are commonly seen on non-perishable food products, like biscuits, cereals and nuts.Figure 4: The difference between Use By and Best Before dates … #eatitcookitfreezeitThe confusion that results Use By dates and Best Before dates is a key element in food wastage.  People sometimes discard a packet or biscuits that are past their Best Before date, for fear their consumption will make the ill.  These people are getting the Best Before date mixed up with the Use By date.  With few (if any) exceptions, a food beyond its Best Before date is still perfectly fine an acceptable to consume, but there is a (slim) chance it may be of lower quality compared to what you expect or what the product was immediately upon manufacture.  An example of the confusion that can result is shown in Figure 5.  Here we have a mouldy orange.  It is clearly spoiled, but cannot make you sick if you ate it.  Therefore, this flyer should have used “Best Before” rather than “Use By” because the quality of this fruit has deteriorated but it would still be safe to eat.Figure 5: This flyer should refer to the “Best Before” date rather than than the “Use By” date.Think about this: Perception of “off” or spoiled food is very much based on society norms or maybe even individual norms.  Take dairy yogurt, how did that originate?  Quite possibly like this … someone milked a cow, left the raw milk sitting around at 30°C or 40°C  for a day, then they tasted they lumpy and sour milk and thought that it was pretty nice.  This is a simplification of the more popular story of yogurt origin which says that ancient (about 5000 BC) herders from Central Asia stored milk in bags made of animal stomachs, which, after a period of time in the warm sun, ws enough to turn the liquid milk into semi-solid yogurt.   It might just be milk that has gone “off”, but maybe they bottled it, put the name “yogurt” on the outside and promoted it as a new fermented dairy product with a myriad of health benefits.  …and these fermented food products, my friends, are one of the hottest food trends of our time (Figure 6), even though the product and the concept probably originated as spoiled food in ancient times.  With that thought, I’ll leave it there.Figure 6: Fermented foods are the hottest trend in food.","best before, expiry date, food microbiology, Food safety, food science, use by"
Food quality,"eukaryotic-microbiology, food-quality, fungi, yeast","Yeasts and food spoilage: Part 1, Overall importance and general characteristics.",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/yeasts-and-food-spoilage-part-1-overall-importance-and-general-characteristics/,"January 5, 2020","By: Doreen Ting and Philip ButtonOriginally written by Ms Doreen Ting in 2008, with guidance from Dr Philip Button.  Current update and partial rewrite by Dr Philip Button.Food serves as a source of nutrition for humans and animals. However, it also serves as a substrate for the growth of microorganisms. The growth of microorganisms can be beneficial (for example, during production of fermented foods) as well as non-beneficial (growth in food leading to spoilage). Yeast (unicellular fungi) are undoubtedly the most important group of microorganisms exploited for commercial purposes, in particular bread making and the production of alcoholic beverages (Deak & Beuchat, 1996). To give an indication of the economic importance of wine to the Australian, data from Wine Australia (2019) show 63% of Australian wine is exported to a total value of $2.8 billion.  However, yeast has also been a major concern in the food industry in terms of their ability to alter the quality of food products, hence impacting shelf life. The undesirable growth of yeast in some food products causes significant economic losses to the food industry. Deak & Beuchat (1996) state that yeast in general, are capable of growing in a wide range of foods under very specific environmental conditions, and under such conditions, metabolic activities of yeast may result in extensive economic losses to the food industry.  Such conditions include 65-70% (w/w) sucrose, where the extremely low water activity results in very limited competition (Tokuoka, 1993).  Spoilage of food products by yeast is detectable through odour or taste, in addition to physical changes. Therefore, in hopes of finding the best control method for these spoilage yeasts, one approach is adopting a “hurdle technology” concept such as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, which will be detailed in a subsequent part in this series.Yeast are certainly of special interest to food microbiologists due to the significant economical losses they cause to the food and beverage industry.  This is especially so because they are able to grow in a wide range of food; high (syrups) to low (beverages) viscosity food, high sugar to high salt content food, and solid food such as fruits.  These yeasts are characterised by their ability to not only survive, but thrive in environments hostile to many other microorganisms (Makdesi & Beuchat, 1996).  While osmotolerance is generally recognised across this genus (El Halouat  & Debevere, 1996), Malfeito-Ferreira (2019) says thatZ. rouxiiis recognised for its high-level osmotolerance whileZ. bailiihas a reputation for resistance to multiple normally lethal conditions, such as low pH, high organic acid concentration, preservatives and it also possess high osmotolerance.  Its ability to tolerate stress conditions is of major concern to the food industry, and in fact Malfeito-Ferreira (2019) states that members of theZygosaccharomycesgenus are amongst the most “feared” spoilage organisms amongst manufacturers of high sugar and high acid products.Z. bailii(Figure 1) in particular, is recognised as “the most preservative-resistant organism known” (Stratford & Capell, 2003).  Not only that, but stress cross protection has been observed in this species where exposure to a given preservative confers resistance to other preservative agents (Stratfordet al., 2013).  Furthermore, the fructose fermentation preference (typically producing acid and gas) ofZ.bailiiis a less common characteristic that can be exploited in its isolation from spoiled foods (Smittle & Flowers, 1982). These are major yeast contaminants, spoiling foods and beverages such as pickles, dried fruits (Verma & Joshi, 2000; Deak & Beuchat, 1996), mayonnaise (Kurtzmanet al., 1971), fruit concentrates (Thomas & Davenport, 1985), soft drinks (Thomas & Davenport, 1985) and red wine (Malfeito-Ferreira, 2019).Figure 1:Zygosaccharomyces bailiiImage source: M. Stratford, C.J. Capell, inEncyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition (Second Edition), 2003Yeast have created undesirable properties in food products including off flavours and haze (Rodrigues et al., 2001) along with excessive carbon dioxide production (Zuehlke, 2003).Z. bailiiis known to metabolise much aggressively compared to the other two species,Z. rouxiiandZ. bisporus. This not only has caused spoilage of food but also has lead to explosion of canned and bottled foods and beverages on the shelf (Levya et al., 1999; Oda et al., 2006).ReferencesDeak, T & Beuchat, LR (1996).

food regulations,food-regulations,Training for food handlers in the United States,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/training-for-food-handlers-in-the-united-states/,"May 3, 2024","Food safety, done right, will save lives, eliminate illness and reduce economic impact.  Everyone along the agrifood supply chain has a role to play, and everyone’s role is important.  It all starts with primary produces and the agricultural environment, where Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) produces high quality, that’s high microbial quality, products from farms, which have a substantial impact further along the agrifood supply chain.  While the food production environment plays a vital first step, those efforts can go to waste if there’s poor cleaning during manufacturing (which is not an example of Good Manufacturing Practice) or poor temperature control during distribution and storage.  Then after the retail environment, consumers have a responsibility too, to maintain appropriate temperature control and not cross-contaminate, among other essential food safety practices.In food service operations, diners have a rightful expectation that their meals will be prepared in a safe way.  The same goes for people buying artisanal manufactured products from cottage food manufacturers, as they are known in the United States, or simply people that that are manufacturing food in their domestic kitchen and then selling to the public.  You cannot do this without consideration of the proper legal framework in place to protect consumers, public health and ultimately society.  As we heard in last year’s (2023) World Food Day theme,Food Standards Save Lives.The first step to keeping your diners or customers safe, and avoiding costly and reputation-damaging products recalls, is to ensure good food safety practices are observed.  This is an easy and straightforward ‘prevention is better than cure’ approach, which when done well, does make the world of difference.  Of course, unexpected aspects happen, which is the theme of this year’s World Food Safety Day (expect the unexpected), but by and large the well honed processes and procedures in place will make the world of difference, such as using a HACCP-based food safety plan.We know it’s important, so as people that are not food safety microbiologists, how they take appropriate actions to train themselves to save lives, illness and reputations.  Well, it all depends where you live.  In Australia for example, it is local councils that regulate such matters, which includes ensuring that designated food safety supervisors have completed appropriate training, which gives them the responsibility to supervisor the preparation or manufacture of food, under certain circumstances or conditions.  Permits, audits and the like are carried out by the lowest level of government in Australia, that operates at the community level.In the United States, each state has slightly different requirements with regard to food safety, and especially cottage food manufacturers.  Thus, it is absolutely essential to obtain state-based, rather than federal, advice and guidance on what you need to so that you are legally compliant in the food safety space, within your jurisdiction.  Each food handler in the United States requires an employee food handler card, not just supervisors, so everyone that handles food.  To make the situation slightly tricky, there are differences between states, at a range of levels.  Therefore, to legally handle food in a food service establishment or during cottage food manufacturing, you need to complete food handler trining for your state.FoodSafePal is your one stop shop in the US for employee food handler cards, for all states.

The evolution of technology, changes in regulatory frameworks, and heightened awareness among consumers and producers alike have contributed to a substantial improvement in the safety of the nation’s food supply.Advancements in technologyOne of the key factors driving improvements in food safety is the integration of advanced technologies throughout the food production and distribution chain. From farm to fork, innovations such as DNA testing, blockchain, and rapid pathogen detection systems have revolutionised the way authorities and producers monitor and control food safety.The implementation of DNA testing has enabled more accurate and rapid identification of foodborne pathogens, helping to trace the source of contamination swiftly. This has proven crucial in preventing widespread outbreaks and facilitating targeted recalls, minimising the impact on public health.Blockchain technology has been introduced to enhance traceability in the food supply chain. By creating an immutable ledger of transactions, stakeholders can quickly identify the origin of a product and trace its journey through various stages of production and distribution. This transparency not only expedites the identification of contaminated products but also encourages accountability among food producers.Rapid pathogen detection systems have significantly shortened the time required to identify potential threats in food products. Traditional testing methods often took days to deliver results, allowing contaminated products to reach consumers. With rapid detection systems, the industry can now respond swiftly to potential hazards, preventing the distribution of unsafe products.Regulatory enhancementsOver the past three decades, the U.S. government has taken proactive measures to strengthen the regulatory framework governing food safety. The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enacted in 2011, marked a landmark shift from reactive to preventive measures. FSMA empowered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to focus on preventing foodborne illnesses rather than merely responding to outbreaks.The implementation of FSMA introduced a risk-based approach to inspections, emphasizing preventive controls, hazard analysis, and traceability. This shift has not only improved the overall safety of the food supply but has also fostered a culture of continuous improvement among food producers.Increased global collaborationGlobalisation has transformed the food industry, making it more interconnected than ever before. Recognizing the importance of collaboration in ensuring food safety, the United States has actively engaged in international partnerships and information sharing. Collaborative efforts with other nations, international organisations, and industry stakeholders have facilitated the exchange of best practices, scientific knowledge, and technological advancements.The Codex Alimentarius, a collection of international food standards, guidelines, and codes of practice, has provided a common ground for countries to harmonise their food safety regulations. By actively participating in such global initiatives, the United States has contributed to the development of a comprehensive and standardized approach to food safety on a global scale.Consumer awareness and educationIncreased awareness among consumers regarding food safety issues has played a pivotal role in driving industry-wide improvements. With access to information at their fingertips, consumers are now more informed about potential risks associated with food consumption. This heightened awareness has created a demand for transparency from food producers and has encouraged the adoption of safer practices throughout the supply chain.Educational campaigns, both from government agencies and non-profit organisations, have empowered consumers to make informed choices about the food they purchase and consume. Understanding the importance of proper food handling, storage, and preparation has become ingrained in the public consciousness, contributing to a reduction in foodborne illnesses.ConclusionThe last 30 years have witnessed a remarkable transformation in the landscape of food safety in the United States. Technological advancements, regulatory reforms, global collaboration, and increased consumer awareness have collectively contributed to a safer and more secure food supply. While challenges persist, the strides made in this period underscore a commitment to continuous improvement and a shared responsibility among stakeholders to safeguard the health and well-being of the American public. As the nation moves forward, it is essential to build upon these achievements, embracing emerging technologies and collaborative strategies to further enhance the resilience and effectiveness of the U.S. food safety system.","food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease"

This year’s theme is about how food standards in food safety save lives.  There’s no doubt that they do.  When one looks back to the 19th century, even, or maybe especially, in the the great industrialised nations of the modern world, up and coming food manufacturers, either out of ignorance or deliberately, manufactured foods that were certainly not in the public’s best interests.  While we don’t have the level of morbidity and mortality we once did, there’s no doubt that foodborne disease represents a totally unacceptable high amount of illness, death and economic burden in our communities.  What makes it even more difficult to understand is that foodborne illness is largely preventable, through the following of procedures, processes and protocols that have been developed following rigorous basic scientific research.  Thus, food standards at all levels (local, state, federal), play an absolutely critical role in safeguarding the food supply of a nation.In this article, we want to focus on the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), a turning point in food safety in the United States that came into being only 12 years ago.IntroductionFSMA, enacted in 2011, is a landmark legislation that revolutionized food safety practices in the United States. Designed to address the challenges posed by an increasingly complex and global food supply chain, the FSMA introduced a comprehensive framework to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure the safety of the nation’s food supply. This article examines the key provisions of the FSMA, its impact on the food industry, and the strides made in safeguarding public health through enhanced preventive measures and regulatory oversight.Overview of the FSMAThe FSMA shifted the focus of food safety in the USA from reactive measures to a proactive, preventive approach. It empowered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the authority to set stringent standards and regulations across the entire food supply chain, from farm to fork. The act encompasses several key components, including preventative controls, inspections, import safety, response to outbreaks, and enhanced partnerships.Preventive controlsOne of the cornerstones of the FSMA is the establishment of preventive controls to identify and address potential hazards before they can cause harm. This includes the implementation of Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) by food facilities. HARPC mandates a systematic approach to evaluate and prevent biological, chemical, and physical hazards in food production, processing, and distribution. It requires food manufacturers to develop and implement comprehensive food safety plans, conduct regular risk assessments, and institute preventive measures.Inspections and complianceThe FSMA introduced a risk-based inspection strategy to ensure compliance with food safety standards. It provided the FDA with increased authority to conduct inspections, sampling, and testing of food facilities. The act also mandated the establishment of a third-party certification program, enabling accredited auditors to assess and certify compliance with the FSMA requirements. Non-compliant facilities can be subject to corrective actions, penalties, and even product recalls if necessary.Import safetyRecognizing the importance of imported foods in the American market, the FSMA strengthened the FDA’s oversight of imported food products. It mandated the development of a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP), which places responsibility on importers to verify that their foreign suppliers meet U.S. safety standards. The act also granted the FDA authority to refuse entry to imported goods from non-compliant facilities and increased the frequency of inspections for high-risk products.Outbreak response and partnershipsIn the event of a foodborne illness outbreak, the FSMA equipped the FDA with enhanced tools to respond swiftly and effectively. It established a food tracing system to track and trace products throughout the supply chain, enabling rapid identification of the source of contamination. Furthermore, the FSMA emphasized collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies, as well as industry stakeholders, to share information and resources and foster a culture of proactive food safety practices.Impact and challengesThe FSMA has had a profound impact on the food industry, leading to improved food safety practices and reduced foodborne illnesses. By shifting the focus towards prevention, the act has encouraged proactive measures, such as better recordkeeping, increased training, and improved sanitation practices. However, implementing the FSMA’s requirements posed challenges for smaller farms and food facilities due to resource constraints and compliance costs. To address these concerns, the FDA has provided educational resources, technical assistance, and flexibility in certain compliance deadlines.ConclusionThe Food Safety Modernization Act has transformed the landscape of food safety in the USA.

Food safety,"bacteria, food-safety",Why is Campylobacter jejuni foodborne disease so common?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/why-is-campylobacter-jejuni-foodborne-disease-so-common/,"May 20, 2023","HISTORY AND BACKGROUNDCampylobacter jejuniwas discovered in 1886 by a Belgian veterinarian named Theobald Smith, who identified it in the intestinal tract of a pig. However, the bacterium was not officially named until 1972, when it was isolated from human feacal samples by researchers in England and namedCampylobacter jejuniby Dr. P.A. Skirrow.Throughout the 1970s and 1980s,Campylobacter jejuniwas recognized as a significant cause of gastroenteritis in humans, particularly in developed countries. Advances in laboratory techniques allowed for more accurate diagnosis and surveillance ofCampylobacterinfections, and the bacterium was increasingly identified as a major cause of foodborne illness.In the 1990s, a large outbreak ofCampylobacterinfection occurred in the United States, linked to contaminated raw milk. The outbreak highlighted the importance of proper food handling and pasteurisation in preventing the spread ofCampylobacter.In the early 2000s, the genome ofCampylobacter jejuniwas sequenced, providing important insights into the bacterium’s biology and pathogenicity. Research continues to focus on understanding the mechanisms by whichCampylobactercauses illness and developing new strategies for prevention and treatment of infection.PATHOGENIC SPECIES OF CAMPYLOBACTERampylobacterspecies that cause foodborne disease are found in a variety of locations, including in the intestinal tracts of animals and humans, as well as in the environment. The most common species that cause foodborne illness isCampylobacter jejuni, but other species that can cause illness include:Campylobacter coli: Commonly found in pigs and can cause foodborne illness in humans.Campylobacter lari: Commonly found in seabirds and shellfish and can cause illness in humans.Campylobacter upsaliensis: Commonly found in dogs and cats and can cause illness in humans.Campylobacter fetus: Commonly found in cattle and sheep and can cause illness in humans, particularly in pregnant women.TheseCampylobacterspecies can contaminate food and water sources, and can also be spread through contact with infected animals or fecal matter. Improper handling and cooking of contaminated food can lead to the transmission ofCampylobacterspecies and subsequent illness in humans.WHERE CAN CAMPYLOBACTER BACTERIA BE FOUND?Campylobacter jejuniis commonly found in raw or undercooked poultry, such as chicken and turkey. In fact, contaminated poultry is one of the most common sources ofCampylobacterinfection. The bacterium can also be found in other types of meat, such as beef and pork, as well as in unpasteurized milk and untreated water sources.In addition,Campylobacter jejunican be present on the surfaces of raw meat and poultry, as well as on utensils, cutting boards, and other equipment used in the preparation of contaminated meat. Cross-contamination of other foods during food preparation is a common route of transmission.Other foods that have been implicated inCampylobacterinfections include raw shellfish, particularly oysters, and contaminated produce, such as raw vegetables and fruit that have been fertilized with contaminated manure or irrigated with contaminated water.WHAT FOODS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CAMPYLOBACTER FOODBORNE DISEASE?Campylobacter jejuniis commonly found in raw or undercooked poultry, such as chicken and turkey. In fact, contaminated poultry is one of the most common sources ofCampylobacterinfection. The bacterium can also be found in other types of meat, such as beef and pork, as well as in unpasteurized milk and untreated water sources.In addition,Campylobacter jejunican be present on the surfaces of raw meat and poultry, as well as on utensils, cutting boards, and other equipment used in the preparation of contaminated meat. Cross-contamination of other foods during food preparation is a common route of transmission.Other foods that have been implicated inCampylobacterinfections include raw shellfish, particularly oysters, and contaminated produce, such as raw vegetables and fruit that have been fertilized with contaminated manure or irrigated with contaminated water.It’s important to note that not all animals or food products are contaminated withCampylobacter, and proper food handling, preparation, and cooking can help to reduce the risk of infection. Cooking meat and poultry to a safe internal temperature is particularly important in preventingCampylobacterinfection.JUST WHY ARE CAMPYLOBACTER BACTERIA RESPONSIBLE FOR SO MANY CASES OF FOODBORNE DISEASE?Campylobacter jejuniis one of the most common causes of foodborne illness worldwide. This bacterium is responsible for causing gastroenteritis, which is an infection of the digestive system. There are several reasons whyCampylobacter jejuniis so common in causing foodborne illness:Prevalence in animal populations:Campylobacter jejuniis commonly found in the intestinal tracts of many domestic and wild animals, including chickens, cattle, and pigs. As a result, contaminated animal products such as meat and milk are common sources of infection.Resistance to environmental stress:Campylobacter jejuniis able to survive in a wide range of environmental conditions, including refrigeration and freezing. This allows the bacterium to survive on food surfaces and in water sources.Low infectious dose: The infectious dose ofCampylobacter jejuniis relatively low, which means that a small amount of contaminated food can cause illness.Human susceptibility: Humans are highly susceptible toCampylobacter jejuniinfection, especially young children and the elderly. In addition, people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop severe illness.Cross-contamination:Campylobacter jejunican easily be spread from contaminated food to other surfaces and foods through cross-contamination, such as when preparing food in the same area or with the same utensils as contaminated food.Improper cooking: Cooking meat and poultry to a safe temperature is essential to preventCampylobacter jejuniinfection. However, many people do not cook their food to the recommended temperature, which can allow the bacterium to survive and cause illness.",

These are my absolute favourites in the disciplines I hold nearest and dearest to my heart.  I have been a student of biochemistry and microbiology, lectured in these subject areas and been a researcher too in bacterial physiology, enzymology and protein chemistry.  So really, biochemistry and microbiology are the disciplines at the core of my scientific expertise.To me, the right book just inspires and excites.  Choose the wrong book, and an exciting topic becomes dull and boring.  These books just bring alive the exciting world of biochemistry and microbiology in a logical way through easy-to-read text, appropriate tables and figures and a natural flow of topics.  Some books just don’t do that.If you wish to buy a book in these subject areas, I very highly recommend these titles.  Furthermore, if you follow these links to buy them on Amazon, then I’ll earn a commission, at no extra cost to yourself.  Every so often, I’ll introduce and describe some products that I love and wholeheartedly support.  Then, I’ll move them to a dedicated page on my website here for products I love and how to buy them.  Please support Food Microbiology Academy and buy your books, and other products I recommend, through here!  Many thanks…Bailey and Scott’s Diagnostic MicrobiologyI used this book as a 3rd-year undergraduate student of clinical microbiology at James Cook University (Townsville, Queensland, Australia) in 1997.  While it wasn’t full of fancy colours, at least not then, it was packed with tables and all the absolutely necessary information about microorganisms of clinical significance.Prescott’s MicrobiologyIn 2008, I was the sole lecturer for a 1st-year subject introductory microbiology subject in the biotechnology Bachelor degree course at Box Hill Institute in Melbourne.  When it came time to select the prescribed textbook for my students, there was no doubt in my mind, of course it was going to be Prescott’s Microbiology.Stryer’s BiochemistryWhile I’ve never used it as a student or a lecturer, Stryer has always been my first choice reference source for general and introductory biochemistry.  Comprehensive account of classical biochemistry, this text has stood the test of time for nearly 50 years.  Hard to beat that.Doyle’s Food MicrobiologyOver the years, I have been in awe of the content of Michael Doyle’s amazing book on food microbiology.  A truly tremendous resource that properly covers the field of food microbiology.  If you’re going to compile, then do it properly, and this is one of the very best.Denniston’s General, Organic and BiochemistryAs a lecturer of 1st-year chemistry in 2009 at what is now Melbourne Polytechnic, this was easily my go-to choice of prescribed textbook for my students.

Food safety,"bacteria, food-safety, public-health",Aeromonas hydrophila – is it worth worrying about?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/aeromonas-hydrophila-is-it-worth-worrying-about/,"January 25, 2023","Aeromonas hydrophilais a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the family Aeromonadaceae. It was first identified by a Japanese scientist in 1892 and is considered as one of the first species of the genusAeromonas.   The genus Aeromonas, is composed of several species,Aeromonas hydrophilais one of the most well-known and studied species in this genus.  It is important to note that,Aeromonas hydrophilais considered a complex species, meaning that it is composed of several sub-groups with different levels of pathogenic potential, which can cause different types of infections in humans and animals.Taxonomically,Aeromonas hydrophilafalls under the following classification:Domain: BacteriaPhylum: ProteobacteriaClass: GammaproteobacteriaOrder: AeromonadalesFamily: AeromonadaceaeGenus:AeromonasSpecies:Aeromonas hydrophilaThis species is commonly found in freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. It can also be found in brackish water and in the intestinal tracts of some fish species. In fish,Aeromonas hydrophilacan cause a variety of diseases, including septicemia, wound infections, and fin and tail rot. Symptoms of a fish infected withAeromonas hydrophilamay include redness, swelling, and ulceration of the skin, as well as fin and tail damage. It’s important to maintain good water quality and hygiene in fish tanks and aquaculture systems to prevent the spread ofAeromonas hydrophilaand other fish diseases. If your fish are showing signs of infection, it’s best to consult a veterinarian or fish health expert for proper diagnosis and treatment.  The presence ofAeromonas hydrophilain the aquatic environment is not necessarily a cause for concern, as the bacteria is a normal part of the aquatic microbial community. However, high levels of the bacteria in water or fish may indicate poor water quality or overcrowding in aquaculture systems, which can lead to increased risk of disease in fish and other aquatic animals.A. hydrophilacan cause foodborne illness in humans, although it is less common than other foodborne pathogens such asSalmonellaandE. coli. The bacteria can be found in raw or undercooked meat and seafood, as well as in fresh produce that has been contaminated with water or sewage. Aeromonas hydrophila can also survive and grow in refrigerated foods, making it important to store and handle food properly to prevent the growth and spread of the bacteria.Symptoms ofAeromonas hydrophilainfection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever. These symptoms usually appear within 24 to 48 hours after consuming contaminated food. In severe cases, Aeromonas hydrophila infection can lead to dehydration and blood infections.To prevent foodborne illness caused byAeromonas hydrophila, it is important to handle food properly, cook meat and seafood thoroughly, and to practice good personal hygiene. It is also important to properly clean and sanitize cutting boards and other kitchen tools to prevent cross-contamination.AlthoughAeromonas hydrophilais a rare cause of foodborne illness, there have been several reported outbreaks of disease associated with the bacteria in recent years.In 2019, United Kingdom, over 30 cases. Cause: raw or undercooked meat from a local butcher shop.In 2018, United States, over 20 cases. Cause: raw or undercooked pork products from a local distributor.In 2017, Germany, over 50 cases. Cause: raw or undercooked fish products from a local market.In 2015, United States, over 20 cases. Cause: raw oysters harvested from a local estuary.These are just a few examples of reported outbreaks involvingAeromonas hydrophila, it’s important to note that most cases of foodborne illness caused byAeromonasare not reported or recognized, it is usually underdiagnosed due to its similarity to other enteric pathogens.Aeromonas hydrophilacan be identified in the microbiology laboratory using a variety of methods, including cultural, biochemical, serological, and molecular techniques.Cultural methods involve growing the bacteria on selective and differential media, such as thiosulfate-citrate-bile-sucrose (TCBS) agar or cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (CIN) agar, which are formulated to selectively promote the growth ofAeromonasspecies while inhibiting the growth of other bacteria.Biochemical methods involve testing the bacteria’s ability to ferment various sugars or produce certain enzymes. For example,Aeromonashydrophila is able to ferment lactose and produce the enzyme catalase.Serological methods, such as the slide agglutination test, can be used to identifyAeromonas hydrophilaby detecting specific antigens in the bacteria.Molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing, can be used to specifically detect and identifyAeromonas hydrophilaby targeting specific genetic regions of the bacteria.It’s worth to note that,Aeromonas hydrophilais a part of theAeromonasgenus which encompasses a number of species, therefore it is important to use multiple methods to confirm the identification ofAeromonas hydrophilain the lab.","fish disease, food microbiology, food science, foodborne disease"

Bacteriophage, or phage for short, are viruses of bacteria, meaning that bacteriophage therapy is a biological control concept, and is a natural approach to combat bacteria.  As phage, like all viruses, are non-living entities, meaning they don’t fulfil the criteria for life, they are dependent on bacteria for their survival.  Therefore, no (bacterial) host cells, no phage.  Thus, it is impossible for them to proliferate out of control.  While bacteriophage therapy for human infectious disease dates back around a hundred years at its peak, a newer concept is phage-based biocontrol of foodborne pathogens and bacterial spoilage microorganisms.  This would tick all the boxes for a safe and effective, natural approach to handle the public and economic burden of foodborne disease, plus the economic losses associated with the growth of spoilage bacteria.

Food safety,"bacteria, food-safety, public-health",Genetic control of the bacterial adaptive acid tolerance response.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/genetic-control-of-the-bacterial-adaptive-acid-tolerance-response/,"September 1, 2021","In 1998 and 1999, at what is now the Mount Helen campus of Federation University in Ballarat, Victoria, I completed my Honours degree in food science, submitting my thesis on 16 July 1999 and graduating in May the following year.  My thesis was in the area of bacterial physiology, specifically on the adaptive acid tolerance response in two key food borne disease bacteria – the Gram negativeEscherichia coliand the Gram positiveStaphylococcus aureus.  Many physiological mechanisms may contribute to this acid tolerance response, which has much significance in food manufacturing and indeed the virulence of these bacteria, which ultimately, makes this physiological phenomenon of public health significance too.  An increased acid tolerant state may offer enhanced survival in low pH foods and aid subsequent gastric passage, enabling proliferation further along the gastrointestinal tract.  Thus, the adaptive acid tolerance response is considered a virulence factor as it contributes to pathogenesis.  In this blog article, I want to cover just two of the (genetic) bases for an adaptation to extremes and normally lethal pH values.  Please note though that my thesis was submitted in July of 1999, and therefore this piece of writing covers the knowledge in this area up to that date only.4.7.2 GenesA number of genes have been identified which directly or indirectly assist bacteria in their attempt to survive low pH conditions.  With S. typhimurium, at least 17 genes have been identified(Foster, 1995).  These are reviewed byFoster (1995).  Of these, two genes,rpoSandfurwill be discussed further.Some genes, present in a variety of bacterial species, are widely accepted as regulators of inducible acid tolerance, such asrpoSand probablyfur.  However, some specific genes may play an essential role in the inducible acid tolerance of certain bacteria, for example,actAinRhizobium meliloti(Tiwari et. al., 1996).4.7.2.1rpoSgeneTherpoSgene is a member of a group of genes that enable survival under a range of extreme conditions.  A related gene, also widely researched (Huang et. al., 1998;Emetz and Klug, 1998), isrpoH, required for the heat shock response ofE. coli.Cheville et al. (1995)have demonstrated the vital nature ofrpoSin a variety of acidic conditions, including fermented meat, and in addition, found that the stationary phase RpoS protein gave tolerance to heat and salt.Salmonellahave also been shown (through gene cloning experiments) to requirerpoSto tolerate acid(Lee et. al., 1995)while similar observations have been made withBacillus subtilis(Hecker and Volker, 1998).  More importantly, the alternative sigma factor encoded byrpoSand the subsequent acid shock proteins, such as RpoS, induced a sustained ATR rather than just a transient induced tolerance to acid(Lee et. al., 1995).  They have shown that induction of the transient ATR can occur without RpoS but for the cells to survive beyond 20min in low pH, RpoS is required.  The central role played by therpoSgene has been clearly demonstrated in a number of species by the construction of mutants lacking this gene.  These species includeS. flexneri(Waterman and Small, 1996)andS.Typhimurium(Wilmes-Risenberg et. al., 1997).  As well as enabling survival in extreme heat, salt and acid, alternate sigma factors (in this situation, alternate sigma factor 54) can also function in times of nitrogen deprivation of the cell via the generpoN, as described byLewin (1994).  While these groups of genes are responsible for enabling survival in a variety of stress responses, rpoS itself can provide general stress protection against diverse environmental conditions.  For example, inPseudomonas aeruginosa,rpoSincreases resistance up to three-fold against heat, low pH, high osmolarity, hydrogen peroxide and ethanol(Jorgensen et. al., 1999).4.7.2.2 fur geneResponsible for iron uptake, thefur(ferric uptake regulator) gene has been shown byLee et. al. (1995)to be necessary for a transient ATR inS.Typhimurium whileFoster and Hall (1992)describe the contribution of the Fur protein to expression of fur as “extensive”.Bagg and Neilands (1987)describe the action of Fur and state that the most obvious means of action is that transcription offuris repressed by Fur binding to Fe, which reversibly attaches to the operator sequence.  Perhaps unexpectedly, the ATR function of Fur is not induced by iron with both systems (iron acquisition and ATR) acting independently of each other(Hall and Foster, 1996).S.Typhimuriumfurmutans demonstrate the importance of this gene as shown by the work ofFoster (1993)who has shown that afurmutant was unable to induce pre- or post-shock acid adaptation and also byWilmes-Riesenberg et. al. (1996)who found that this mutant had reduced virulence as the LD50 (in mice) was higher, up to a 3-log increase.  Although not a direct mutation infur,Foster and Bearson (1994)have shown thatS.Typhimurium mutants with mutations inatrDandatrF(these mutations affect iron metabolism and regulation) are acid-sensitive.  They state that this supports the idea of the involvement of Fur-regulated genes in inducible acid tolerance.",
Food safety,"bacteria, food-safety",Sous vide and food safety,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/sous-vide-and-food-safety/,"August 25, 2021","One of our two recently commenced student interns is Gaurav Joshi.  Gaurav is a senior professional chef, making a career change to food science.  He’s currently studying at RMIT University in Melbourne.  Combining his interests and backgrounds in professional cooking and food safety, Gaurav suggested a blog article on the food safety aspects of Sous Vide cooking … and here it is!Unlike food manufacturing, where strict time and temperature combinations are rigorously observed, the realm of hospitality and domestic cooking abounds with questionable preparation methods, from a food safety context.  While thermal processing or non-thermal processing of equivalent severity must be employed the world over, regardless of jurisdiction (although I’m sure there are obscure exceptions!), uncooked food (i.e. raw!) is permitted in the hospitality industry.  Why is the strict adherence to microbial food safety in food manufacturing not observed in hospitality?  That’s the topic for another blog article, for sure.  However, one point is for sure, you can rely on the microbial food safety of industrially manufactured food – but not so with food in the hospitality scene.  No matter what people say or how much they try and convince you, food that is not prepared to government-stated food safety conditions is not safe.  There’s no such thing as “cooking” food with lemon juice for example, as is done with ceviche.  Yes, true, the low pH of the lemon juice will denature the fish proteins, giving it the appearance of being “cooked”, as it has physically changed appearance, but don’t be fooled – the fish is still unsafe to eat as it is raw, it hasn’t actually been cooked yet.So how about cooking techniques that use moderate heat?  One of those is sous vide, which uses temperatures which hover just below and a little above the temperature danger zone.  Does that make it risky from a food safety perspective?  It sure does.  The temperature danger zone is between 5 °C – 60 °C, which means to be safe, food must be kept for extended periods below 5 °C or above 60 °C.  Extended periods means beyond four hours, because once food has been in the temperature danger zone for a total of four hours (not just four consecutive hours, but four hours in total), it is considered unsafe and must be discarded.  When one considers that cooking some meat rare by sous vide has food sitting in the temperature danger zone for up to 72 hours, once starts to see just how risky and unsafe sous vide is!While different bacteria are inactivated at different rates at different temperatures, there’s a general consensus, as echoed by the recommendations of public health authorities, that temperatures over 70 °C are required for safe cooking of food.  That would be the basis for the temperature danger zone ending at 60 °C, then there’s a margin of safety, then approximately 70 °C and above is a safe cooking temperature.  Therefore, when you have food cooking for any period of time in the temperature danger, let alone several, there’s no doubt the element of risk is increased.  Clearly, this is an element of risk that doesn’t need to be introduced.Let us look at it closer … the D value, which in thermal inactivation is the decimal reduction time, is the time at a certain temperature where one log (90%) of microorganisms is eliminated.  In the table extract below, Li and Gänzle (2016) reviewed heat resistance studies ofEscherichia coli, and show that between 55 °C and 58 °C degrees, the D value is around 12 to 15 minutes.  This means that under a worst case scenario of a heavy bacterial load of contaminatingE. coli, it would take nearly 1½hours to reduce the cells to a negligible amount.  With small (2½cm) tender cuts of beef being cooked for just an hour at 57 °C, there’s certainly an element of risk there.  With fish, the situation is even more concerning with, a temperature of just 52 °C used and a cooking time of only 20 to 30 minutes.Furthermore, with lengthy periods at sub-lethal temperatures, any heat resistant mutants will be selected for, as would thermoduric microorganisms.  Both of these will begin to dominate, ultimately proliferating in the cooking food, while the home cook is blissfully unaware of what is happening.What can be done and should we keep eating a food that has potentially to be microbial unsafe?  It is certainly best to avoid such food and cooking methods for meat as it is just not worth it.  This is especially the case if you are a home cook.  Chefs will know how to perfect the technique for exceptional food quality while ensuring a high level of food safety.  However, it is best not to experiment with this technique at home, due to the case at which food safety breaches can be made.  The New South Wales Food Authority in Australia (https://www.foodauthority.nsw.gov.au/consumer/food-at-home/cooking-sous-vide) have put together a guide on how to safely cook sous vide, but whatever the case, best to leave it to the professionals.prepare thinner portions of food so that heating and cooling are rapidkeep water bath temperatures at 55 °C or hotterlimit the time food is cooked at cooler than 55 °C to no more than 6 hoursuse quality equipment with adequate heating capacity and excellent temperature controlcheck water and/or food temperatures with an accurate, tip-sensitive digital thermometer accurate to 0.1 °Cstore prepared foods for no more than 5 daysdo not compound multiple risks, for example, if meat has been mechanically tenderised do not cook large portions for a long time at low temperatures.ReferenceLi H and Gänzle M (2016) Some Like It Hot: Heat Resistance ofEscherichia coliin Food.Front.

However, I don’t believe the place or a role of mainstream media is to write about scientific topics of public health importance, giving advice and interpretation of various aspects that could result in a life or death choice.  Such topics must be left to the professionals.  The idea for this blog article came to mind when I was reading an article indelishdated 12 March 2021 (link below this paragraph), written by Kristin Salaky.  Just to be clear, I don’t have anything against Kristin Salaky as a person (I had never heard of her until reading this article of hers) or her writingper se.  She isn’t a food scientist, not even a scientist, so she can’t be blamed for the errors in her article.  For the record, Kristin has a bachelor degree in journalism from Ohio University and her LinkedIn profile says she has “…a background in women’s and gender studies as well as health…”, yet she is writing on food science.  The problem I have is that mainstream of generic publications for the general public have non-specialists with no real understanding or knowledge writing about topics that could result in a life or death choice – yes, it really is that serious!  Let me take you through parts of her article and explain.Yes, You Can Probably Eat Food (Slightly!) After Its Expiration Date — DelishWhile it is certainly true that food past the Use By date might be safe to eat, the Use By date is there for a reason.  The reason is to let you know the last date the food is guaranteed to be safe to eat.  Yes, true, if it has only been a day or two past the Use By, then it could very well still be ok – I eat food past it’s Use By date, but I consider various factors in making that choice, and I have the benefit of professional understanding in food safety and experience.  Therefore, for consumers, it is certainly not advisable to consume food past it’s Use By date, under any circumstances.  Kristin goes on to say that if the food has no signs of spoilage, then you can make the assumption that the food is safe to eat.  Unfortunately, she is confusing what is probably the most fundamental aspect of food safety and quality, and in the process, misleading readers, which could make a choice based on what she has written, with dire consequences.  Firstly, I must say, she has it wrong – spoilage is unrelated to safety and if a food is not spoiled, that does not mean in any way, shape or form, that you can draw a conclusion about that food’s microbial safety.  The two are independent from one another, not related at all.  This is the reason why there are Use By dates (for food safety purposes) and Best Before dates (for food quality purposes).  A food that is spoiled is almost certainly safe, albeit unpleasant, to eat.  Spoilage microorganisms cannot make you sick.  Foodborne disease comes from eating food contaminated with foodborne pathogenic microorganisms, or their toxins.  These microorganisms or their toxins are present in such low amounts (yet can still cause disease) that you have no way, absolutely no way, or knowing if they are present or not.  Think about, if people could tell if a food was safe to eat because of the way it looked or the smell of it, would people be getting a foodborne disease?  If unsafe food smelled or looked bad or off, nobody would eat it and nobody won’t get foodborne disease.  The fact is, unsafe food smells, looks and tastes normal, completely normal.Again, the above extract from the article in question shows erroneous information.  Curdled milk or slimy meat will be safe to drink/eat, but will of course be extremely unpleasant!  So, I need to reiterate, if it look good and smells good, you can’t say that the food is probably safe, not by a long shot.  Looking good or smelling good is no way related to the microbial safety of a food.It is true that food won’t necessarily be unsafe on a specific date.  For certain foods, as per the food regulations for that country, food manufacturers need to include a Use By date.  However, it is a date that is selected with a margin of error included.   Food waste is a problem, and many safe foods are discarded because they are passed their Use By date.  While discarding food that is past it’s Use By date is what needs to be done, it does certainly result in a degree of unnecessary wastage of good food.  As I’ve outlined, you cannot tell if a food is safe to consume or eat from how it looks or smells, so how can you?  Well, it is a complex process and food safety professionals would use various factors to come to a conclusion in this regard.If you want an question on Use By or Best Before dates, including if a particular food is safe or not, feel free to contact me directly for advice or an answer:You can e-mail me: philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academyOr get a (nearly) instant answer by contacting me on WhatsApp!Chat on WhatsApp",

However, we now increasing are aware of the negative aspects of thermal processing on organoleptic and nutritional quality.  While thermal techniques remain the mainstay of food processing, newer non-thermal technologies are gaining ground, such as high pressure processing (HPP).  From hunter gatherer nomadic lifestyles to high pressure processing – looking forward to seeing what exciting developments the world of food microbiology has in store.Figure 1: Drying herbs to preserve them.Food quality and spoilageThe ultimate reason for food preservation and the need to safely store food is because it “goes off”.  We are all familiar with the concept of food “going off”, with mouldy bread and fruits or slimy meat (Figure 2) for example.  Although these are, by and large, the more commonly encountered causes of food spoilage, there are others.  For example, lumpiness (age gelation, which results from specific protein complexes forming) or sedimentation in UHT (long-life) milk (which results from enzyme action degrading the protein) or the white (or pale yellow) coloured pineapple juice (resulting from ultraviolet light stimulated degradation reactions of the colour compounds).  Food preservation is generally concerned with the maintenance of the quality of food, and consequently to prevent its spoilage and ultimate contribution to the significant (and growing) food waste problem.Figure 2: Spoiled meat.Foodborne disease and food safetyWhat is regarded as foodborne disease can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic.  These types of microorganisms tend to cause foodborne disease in characteristic ways from characteristic foods.  Due to the way and ease with  which foodborne viruses tend to be spread, they tend to be the most common microorganisms.  The faecal-oral route, common with foodborne viruses such as Rotavirus that causes diarrhoea, is a commonly occurring, and easily preventable, means of transmitting foodborne disease.  Pathogenic bacteria are widespread in the natural and artificial environment, grow well in many foods and thrive at temperatures typical of temperature abuse of foods.  Yeast and moulds, although more widespread than bacteria, grow slower than bacteria and tend to be outgrown by bacteria, except in high acid and low water activity foods -intrinsic product parameters which will largely inhibit bacterial growth.  Protozoan parasites and parasitic worms are even less common, as they usually have complex life cycles (Figure 3), sometimes requiring multiple hosts.  They also grow more slowly (than prokaryotes) and have quite narrow requirements for growth parameters.Figure 3: Life cycle ofToxoplasma gondiiExpiry dates: The difference between Use By and Best BeforeA vital distinction to know is the difference between Use By dates and Best Before dates (Figure 4), and how this relates to shelf-life.  To start with though, a common misconception is that unsafe food is somehow different in taste, smell and so, from safe food.  This is almost certainly never true – if that was the case, few people would contract a foodborne disease.  The fact is that the unpleasant changes you see or smell in or on food, are most often the  result of the growth of spoilage microorganisms, which are typically harmless.  Yes, it might be unpleasant to consume some of them, but they won’t make you sick.  They are not pathogenic and have no way to cause disease.  The onset of these unpleasant changes with food can signal the end of shelf-life.  In practice, it is usually subtle quality changes that happen before then, that determine a Best Before date, such as a reduction in crispness of a potato chip, or the way a sauce flows out of the bottle or the reduced carbonation of soft drinks.  The Use By date on the other hand is all about safety – after the Use By date, that food is considered unsafe to eat, and should be discarded.  This is on contrast to the Best Before date, after which, a reduction in expected product quality may be apparent, but the food or drink will still be perfectly safe to consume.Figure 4: The distinction between Use By dates and Best Before dates.",
Food safety,"bacteria, food-safety, probiotics-and-gut-health, public-health",Antibiotic misuse and overuse,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/antibiotic-misuse-and-overuse/,"February 19, 2021","Antibiotics, discovered and commercially developed in the 1930s, have gone from being hailed as ‘magic bullets’ in 1940s human medical practice to nearly a scourge of humanity today, through decades of overuse and misuse in human and veterinary medicine.  As the World Health Organization states, they really do pose a big public health threat, across the world (Figure 1).  Despite being the foundation of ‘miracle’ cures in the early days, those gains in the war against human bacterial diseases are starting to unravel and are at serious risk of being reversed.  Not only that, but residual levels of antibiotics present in the food supply, resulting from widespread use in the agricultural environment has posed additional threats to human health.  These represent another facet of food safety, apart from the more common microbial food safety, which has wide-ranging public health consequences.  Seemingly, the lack of understanding around the molecular genetics of antibiotic resistance development and consumers’ comfort level with antibiotics, means that the general public appears to have very little concern for the environmental, personal health and public health consequences of antibiotic overuse and misuse.  Interestingly, the same people are quite possibly staunchly opposed to genetic modification in agriculture, which has no safety concerns, yet are comfortable with antibiotics, despite their negative impacts on the environment and on humanity.  In this article, I want to focus on the effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and the subsequent negative on that may arise for one’s personal health, which may or may not be able to be rectified through consumption of probiotic foods.  A further consequence could be increased susceptibility to foodborne disease.Figure 1: Antibiotic resistance is a significant public health issue across the planet.One’s gut microbiome, which develops shortly after birth, is a delicately balanced ecosystem of specific bacterial species characteristic of that individual.  While some generalisations can be made, the finer aspects are unique to each of us.  Overall, we still have much to learn and understand about the human gut microbiome (Iizumi, 2017).  However, what we are increasingly gaining an acknowledgement of, and indeed an appreciation for, are the diverse impacts good gut health may have for it’s host.  Conversely, the negative consequences of disruption to our specific balance of bacterial species can have serious detriment.While antibiotics are indeed ‘wonder drugs’ capable of eliminating or stopping the growth of many bacteria, there are downsides.  I’m not just talking about contribution to the devastation of antibiotic resistance prevailing in the world, or the side effects to antibiotic therapy an individual can experience, but to the disruption or sometimes decimation to one’s gut microbiome that may result during a course of antibiotics.  These are potentially big problems of a personal nature for us.It is acknowledged that the gut microbiome, and in fact our natural flora in other parts of the body, plays diverse positive roles in our personal health.  Originally this was thought to be localised, and so consumption of probiotics to ensure gut microbe balance was to have an impact on digestive health.  While this is certainly true, there’s an increasing appreciation of the wide effects.  Not only on physical health, but on mental health too – more information in thisblog articleI wrote towards the end of 2020.So with such a potential wide impact from disruption to one’s gut microbiota, how can we help our ‘friendly’ bacteria to help us?  Keeping personal antibiotic use to an absolute minimum is one way by simply saying no to antibiotics and exploring alternatives (Figure 2).  I for one, have not had to treat an infection of mine using antibiotics since 1990.  The comprehensive review paper (Ferreret al., 2017) on the topic of how the functioning of the gut microbiome is negatively impacted by antibiotic therapy reviews several studies that have demonstrated just how bad antibiotics are for our gut microbiota.  These authors cover numerous references to studies demonstrating the general reduction in total gut bacteria and also for specific taxa.  The complex diagram presented in Figure 3 shows how particular gut bacteria and negatively effected by antibiotics.  This really does highlight the magnitude of the (growing) problem around adverse effects on personal health of antibiotic therapy.Figure 2: Say NO to antibiotics.Figure 3: Complexities of how antibiotics negatively impact bacteria of the gut microbiome.  Source: Ferreret al.(2017).Despite this negativity, there are some interesting opposing results.  Martín-Núñezet al. (2019) found that the significant changes to the gut microbiota in human subjects with antibiotic therapy forHelicobacter pyloriinfection improved host glucose homeostatis.   So it’s not all doom and gloom, but that doesn’t mean we should be encouraging an imbalance of one’s gut microbiota!  Furthermore, Raymondet al. (2016) raises an interesting finding that although negative impacts to the gut microbiome composition take place, they are predictable and with knowledge of an individual’s original gut microbiome profile.Despite the above consequences in the human context, the fact remains that agricultural use of antibiotics accounts for the vast majority of antibiotic sales, in the US (Figure 4).  With the rapidly developing interest in plant-based foods, this will hopefully become less of a problem, but certainly, the absolute dominance of antibiotic use in the context of veterinary medicine as compared with human medicine, is yet another reason to consider plant-based dietary options.Figure 4: Use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine dominates over human medicine.So where does that leave us?  Antibiotics have a place, and if they are used for their intended purpose then it is unlikely we would be in the predicament we find ourselves in now.  Therefore, we all need to contribute and play our part to halt the deleterious effects on our personal health and on our public health by refusing to be part of antibiotic overuse and misuse.ReferencesFerrer, Manuel, Méndez-García, Celia, Rojo, David, Barbas, Coral, & Moya, Andrés.

Food safety,"bacteria, food-safety",The coliform group of bacteria,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-coliform-group-of-bacteria/,"February 13, 2021","Coliforms have historically been an important group of bacteria in food microbiology, for their practical role in serving as indicator organisms for possible faecal contamination and evenE. colicontamination.  This piece of writing was completed by Suryani Tan, one of my 2nd-year food microbiology students at The University of Melbourne in 2007.In order to be valuable as an assessor of faecal contamination, indicator organisms should satisfy the following criteria (Chapman and Hall 1997):• They should be a member of the normal intestinal flora of healthy people.• They should be exclusively intestinal in habitat and therefore exclusively faecal in origin if found outside the intestine.• Ideally they should only be found in humans.• They should be present when faecal pathogens are present and only when faecal pathogens are expected to be present.• They should be present in greater numbers than the pathogen they are intended to indicate.• They should be unable to grow outside the intestine with a die-off rate slightly less than the pathogenic organism.• They should be resistant to natural environmental conditions and to water and wastewater treatment processes in a manner equal to or greater than the pathogens of interest.• They should be easy to isolate, identify and enumerate.• They should be non-pathogenicThe finding of an indicator organism in a properly treated water indicates the presence of material of faecal origin and thus potential contamination (Chapman and Hall 1997).All of the above requirements are fulfilled by the coliform group. Coliform has been the principle means by which the sanitary quality of water is determined. Several other organism such as faecal Streptococci andClostridium perfringensare also used to provide supplementary information in certain circumstances as they also meet many of these requirements (Chapman and Hall 1997).Development of Coliforms as indicator organismsDirect isolation of specific pathogenic organisms were used as the earliest methods of water bacteriology. However, some difficulties were encountered with the detection of typhoid-like organisms. Bacteriologists attempting to overcome the difficulty of isolating such organisms found that human faeces contained large numbers of aerobic, Gram-negative organisms that resemble typhoid bacteria (Chapman and Hall 1997).These bacteria were subsequently found to be bile salt-tolerant, facultatively anaerobic organisms capable of growth and fermenting lactose at 37 degree Celsius. These bacteria are known as colifoms. Coliforms were quickly recognised as possible indicators of faecal pollution and procedures were developed to detect and estimate their numbers in raw waters. The most widely adopted method of isolation was inoculation of MacConkey Broth and incubation at 37 degree Celsius for 48 hours. Cultures producing acid and gas were subsequently subcultured onto MacConkey Agar to eliminate obligate anaerobes. A coliform became any organism that was isolated by this method. Faecal colifoms could produce gas from glucose at 47 degree Celsius while coliforms from non-faecal sources failed to grow at these temperatures. E.coli was also capable of growth and fermenting lactose at this temperature with the production of gas and producing indole from tryptophan (Chapman and Hall 1997).Definition of the coliform groupThe coliform group consists of several genera of bacteria belongings to the familyEnterobacteriaceae. These genera includedEscherichia, Citrobacter, EnterobacterandKlebsiella. The definition of the coliform group has been based on methods used for its detection rather than on the tenets of systematic bacteriology (Chapman and Hall 1997).Sources of coliforms in milk and how pathogenic they areGram-negative bacteria are the agents most often isolated from acute clinical cases of mastitis. The termcoliform mastitisis incorrectly used to identify mammary disease caused by all Gram-negative bacteria. The Genera classified as coliforms areEscherichia, Klebsiella, andEnterobacter.Gram-negative bacteria are considered environmental mastitis pathogens. One of the sources of coliforms contaminants in milk is through the transfer of Gram-negative bacteria from the mammary glands of infected cows to uninfected cows (Hogan and Smith 2003). However, this process appears minimal when compared with the constant environmental exposure. Coliform bacteria occupy many habitats in the cow’s environment. Escherichia coli are the normal inhabitants of the gastrointestinal tract of warm-blooded animals. BothKlebsiellaandEnterobacterspecies populate soils, grains, water, and intestinal tracts of animals. Gram-negative bacteria are usually isolated from any surface of the cow or her surroundings and cause other diseases (Hogan and Smith 2003). Coliform bacteria are among the aetiological agents commonly responsible for infectious respiratory and urogenital diseases in dairy cows. Although the mammary gland is not considered a natural habitat for coliform bacteria, many strains are capable of surviving and multiplying in the mammary gland (Hogan and Smith 2003).EndotoxinEndotoxin is the primary virulence factor of Gram-negative bacteria responsible for damage to the cow. Endotoxin refers to the lipopolysaccharide portion of the Gram-negative bacterial wall. Endotoxin is released from the bacteria at the time of cell death initiating an inflammatory response. Endotoxin does not directly affect secretory cell but distrupts the blood flow (Shuster 1991 cited in Hogan and Smith 2003). Signs of clinical mastitis include anorexic, fever, dehydration and diarrhea. Decreased milk production during clinical coliform mastitis results both directly and indirectly from the local and systematic effects of endotoxin. Coliform mastitis can result is bacteremia and septicemia as the blood-milk barrier is destroyed. Septicemia is rare but often fatal when it occurs (Hogan and Smith 2003).Gram-negative bacteria are the leading cause of clinical mastitis in well-managed dairies with low bulk tank milk somatic cell counts. Coliform pathogens account for the majority of peracute cases of clinical mastitis in a herd (Hogan and Smith 2003).Dry PeriodRates of new intramammary infections caused by coliforms are greater during the dry period than during lactation. During the dry period, susceptibility to intramammary infections is greatest the two weeks after drying off and the two weeks prior to calving. Many infections acquired during the dry period persist to lactation and become clinical cases. 65% of coliform clinical cases that occur in the first two months of lactation are intramammary infections that originated during the dry period. E.coli infections present at calving and early lactation most often originate during the last two weeks of the dry period (Hogan and Smith 2003).LactationColiform intramammary infections’ rate during lactation is highest at calving and decreases as days in milk advances. The average duration ofE. coliintramammary infections during lactation is less than ten days.  A major difference between intramammary infections caused by coliform bacteria and those caused by other Gram-negative bacteria is the duration that bacteria persist in the mammary gland. Intramammary infections caused bySerratiaandPseudomonasspecies often are chronic infections that may persist multiple lactations. Intramammary infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria seldom exceeds 5% of quarters in a herd, however greater than 25% of cows in well-managed herds are diagnosed yearly with clinical mastitis caused by coliforms. Therefore, these diseases caused by these bacteria is seldom great enough to cause bulk tank somatic cell counts (SCC) greater than 400 000/ml but approximately 85% of coliform infections will cause clinical mastitis. Hence, even low SCC herds can still have mastitis problems. The rate of clinical cases caused by Gram-negative bacteria average about 20 cases per 100 cows in a year. The severity of clinical cases caused by coliform bacteria ranges from mild local signs to severe systemic involvement. The majority of clinical coliform cases are characterized by abnormal milk and swollen gland. Only about 10% of clinical coliform cases results in systemic signs including fever, anorexic, and altered respiration. Furthermore, coliform bacteria can also cause peracute mastitis (Hogan and Smith 2003).ReferencesChapman and Hall. 1997. Coliform index and water-borne diseases.

Food safety,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",Our first 50,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/our-first-50/,"February 3, 2021","We’ve hit the half century!  Between 22 December 2019 and today, 3 February 2021, we’ve published 50 blog articles.  What a journey and what a great time we’ve had growing, learning and lending our expertise to solve real-world issues for our clients in different parts of the world.The Food Microbiology Academy journey started during the Black Friday sales of November 2019, with the upgrade of our WordPress website, then we registered our domain name shortly thereafter, and pushed out our first blog article on our website three days before Christmas.  We started with an intention of engaging in primarily research activities, with teaching to support it.  However, it was evident in January 2020 that our expertise in the food preservation space was valued, and we finished a couple of small consulting projects early in February 2020 for clients in London and New York.  Wow yes, our first two clients were located in the two most significant global cities!  During the course of the year we continued to build on our early success in consulting, and took on a Taipei-located lead food safety auditor to our team.  With her industry experience in QC and understanding of bakery manufacture, coupled with her sharp and exacting knowledge of food safety, we greatly expanded our capacity.After working with clients in Bali, Calgary (Alberta, Canada) and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex in the United States, among others, we are now in a position to expand our service offerings and capabilities beyond consulting to the food manufacturing industry.  To this end, we have finalised appointment of someone located in Sydney that will lead our education and training programs, initially online courses in microbiology, but ultimately training programs for the food manufacturing industry.What have we learnt?  As much as I (Philip) was thinking that food safety was what I wanted to be actively involved in, that really doesn’t seem the understanding and expertise the industry needs.  I’m a bacteriologist, and tended to be more interested in food safety.  However, I found that my interests and expertise wasn’t that relevant and it was more mycology along with food quality and spoilage expertise that is actually more useful when consulting to the food manufacturing industry.  Many people wish to optimise or extend the shelf-life of their manufactured food products, and it typically isn’t bacteria that are limiting the shelf-life, more often it is mould growth.  So I found myself getting excited about yeasts and moulds and spoiled food, then working with either I) established small to medium food manufacturers to troubleshoot mould-based spoilage issues and/or extend the shelf-life of those products, particular so that new export markets could be reached or II) food entrepreneurs who need shelf-life and food preservation advice to simply know how long their product will remain stable for.  Yes, it was different to bacterial food borne disease, but this different area I slotted into was a refreshing change, and one which I found satisfying, to an extent I didn’t expect.The next exciting period of our growth is consolidating ourselves in the consulting world, while we establish our offerings in research and in education and training.  To this end, as mentioned above, we have made an appointment of someone to lead our education and training area, and are actively looking to fill our newly created leadership positions in research and in consulting and extension.  With these three functional areas capably led, we’ll be able to advance in accordance with our mission toward our vision.  This is indeed a particularly exciting development early in our second year of operation.What kind of advice or insights may I be able to offer or do I have in food microbiology or in establishing an organisation like this?  Here are some that come to mind:There is plenty of opportunity in food quality and spoilage, as the economic impacts are significant.Resist the temptation to have a business plan at the start of your organisation.  Instead, have a framework and a mindset that allows self-reflection and reflection of the organisation so that change to occur as you work flexibly and fluidly towards attaining a minimum viable product or service.It doesn’t hurt to focus on the basis!  Start small (one person!) and concentrate on your expertise/interests.Another temptation to resist is distraction – many of us with an entrepreneurial mind have too many ideas.  Learn which you should pursue and when you should give them up.Know your WHY.  ‘Why’ you are doing what you’re doing is so important, as a business coach told me a few weeks ago.  My ‘why’ is to improve the quality of life of people – through safer food, fresher food and healthier food.  This is why I love my work, because of the difference I make to the quality of life of people in this way through food.Keep trying things, have outlandish ideas and just give them a go.  People are generally not going to make great strides by playing it safe and adopting a risk-free approach.Most of all, you’ve got to love what you’re doing otherwise you won’t want to do it!",
Food safety,"food-safety, viruses",Food safety and COVID-19,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-safety-and-covid-19/,"January 1, 2021","https://www.facebook.com/1466359001/videos/10225398926387890/On 12 December 2020, I delivered my invited presentation to the Nepalese Association of Victoria during the second and final  session of their food safety and nutritional wellbeing webinar series – many thanks are extended to Dr Yakindra Timilsena from the Association for the invitation.During the first session of this webinar series on October 31, I presented on general food safety precautions plus the early data that was available on retention of activity/infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.  The data which was just coming out in this area during August to October was pretty preliminary and light-on indeed.  However, fast-forward to November and December, and we have more solid evidence available to strengthen the possibility of COVID-19 being a foodborne disease.  Admittedly, some of the available data is so new and recent it is still in the pre-print stage of the publication process, but there are some interesting findings nevertheless.  The most significant I feel is the data which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of surviving or remaining active for 21 days, not only at 4 C or -20 C, but even as low as -80 C.  This is a very significant finding indeed for the global food supply chain, which relies on a cold chain as a key food preservation approach, yet, this very approach might actually be preserving the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and spreading COVID-19 around the world.  So, there is certainly mounting evidence that it is theoretically possible, just very challenging to demonstrate in a practical sense across international jurisdictions.  However, as a result of the evidence, due consideration certainly needs to be given to this transmission route as a possibility.  Previously the best evidence available demonstrated that this virus was able to withstand standard (domestic) freezing conditions in human milk for 48 hours – a most significant result indeed back in August.  However, the most recent finding shows that it can really happen – survival on food products long enough to cross international border in freight supply chains.My contribution to this webinar session (accessible by the link above) was 23 minutes and 42 seconds in duration.  It commences at a recording time of 42:39 and ends at 1:06:21.",
Food safety,"bacteria, food-safety",Food safety and prevention of foodborne illness during the summer holidays,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-safety-and-prevention-of-foodborne-illness-during-the-summer-holidays/,"December 25, 2020","Here we have a Christmas Day special, an article on how to be food-safe this Christmas, and indeed throughout summer.  This article is written by our guest blogger, Collette Arnheim.  Collette is broadly skilled, and qualified in food science (from The University of Melbourne) and dietetics (from Deakin University).  Take heed of her timely and exemplary advice and have a food-safe summer.You can find out more about Collette from her LinkedIn profile –https://www.linkedin.com/in/collette-arnheim/As we head into the summer holidays here in Australia, our days are bound to be filled with picnics, BBQs and outdoor entertaining.  As we take advantage of a COVID-free summer, what doesn’t quite take a summer holiday and may be more prevalent in the hotter months are bacterial pathogens.Bacterial pathogens are those bacteria that can lead to foodborne illness or as we know it “food poisoning” and can cause harm to humans if ingested.  Generally symptoms of food poisoning only last a few days, however if you have ever suffered from it, you will know that those two days are not pleasant!It was estimated that 4.1 million cases of foodborne illness occurred in Australian circa 2010.  With the World Health Organization estimating that one in ten people worldwide will suffer with some form of gastroenteritis foodborne related illness.The main types of bacteria that can cause foodborne illness and can double in number but not be seen when left out in our hot Australian summer sun areCampylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus,Listeria monocytogenes, E. coliandSalmonella.WithSalmonellaandListeria monocytogenesbeing the leading causes of death.The common signs of symptoms of food poisoning are diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, nausea, abdominal cramps, headaches, muscular pain and fatigue.  In certain populations like the elderly, pregnant women and children, food poisoning can cause serious risk and can even be fatal.Transmission of these pathogens into our food system is commonly found at the processing end of the food product however can also occur through the whole food supply chain.  Contamination of our food can be caused by uncleaned faecal material from animals or contaminated water or soil.  Correct food handling is therefore critical to prevent these foodborne pathogens from spreading to our picnic tables.So what can we do to prevent food poisoning during the summer months?Correct food handling–Washing of our fruits and vegetables before consumption.  Washing of hands before preparation and eating.   Not preparing raw meat especially poultry on the same unwashed surface as fruits and vegetables.Read storage instructions on food products –Check the storage instructions on the food products that you buy.  Some will need to be stored in the fridge immediately like fish, cold meats and cheese and others will be able to be left out like fruits and vegetables and non-perishable items. It’s best to check the label before storing your shopping.Reading and knowing the difference between best before date and used by date–Best Before – this product can be consumed after the date however it may compromise the quality of the product.Use By – these products should not be consumed after the date as it can increase the chance of the product being contaminated and increase risk of foodborne illness.Know what you are preparing –Be prepared when packing your picnic, what are the foods that will need to stay cool in an Esky/cooler box (cheese and deli meats) and which ones can be left in the basket without having to be chilled (chips and water crackers). The same goes for when entertaining at home, plus be mindful of serving up a little at a time so that you can restock from the fridge, rather than letting the food stay out on the bench.Temperature danger zone  –Any temperature between 5 °C (40 °F) and 60 °C (140 °F) is known as the danger zone (Figure 1) as bacteria can grow to unsafe levels and cause us to get sick.  It is especially important to not leave food out in the sun for more than 2 hours, which when celebrating in our summer sun can sometimes be hard.Figure 1: The danger zone sourced fromhttps://foodsafety.asn.au/.Keeping food below 5 °C (40 °F) can prevent most bacteria from growing and when eating hot foods we should aim for temperatures above 60° C (140 °F).The general rule for eating food when left outside the fridge within the temperature danger zone is the two/ four hour rule.0 -2 hours – can be eaten2-4 hours – will need to be eaten immediately4 -6 hours – will need to be disposed of.– Freezing and refrigeration of left oversIf food has been left out under the 2 hour rule make sure to refrigerate or freeze immediately, this will slow down or stop any bacterial growth.   Make sure that the fridge is not over packed when storing leftovers, as this can cause an increase in the temperature to above 5 °C (40 °F) and increase the chance of bacterial growth.–Thorough re heating of leftovers.When re-heating left overs, make sure that the meal is heated to above 60 °C (140 °F) and kept warm at that temperature or above.Following these general rules will help to keep you safe over the holidays and help to prevent any food poisoning from occurring.Have a fun and safe summer.Written by –Collette Arnheim,Dietitian, Nutritionist and Food Scientist.BSc, MSc Dietetics and Grad Dip Food Science.https://www.linkedin.com/in/collette-arnheim/References:1.

This era has never seen anything like, and are unlikely to see anything like it.  It is unprecedented.  Despite the substantial volume of scientific, medical and public health literature on the topic, and which continues to emerge, they fact remains that the disease only became (publicly) known to the world in December 2019 and the causal agent only in January 2020.  Thus, it is still very much a ‘new kid on the block’ when it comes to infectious agents, compared toYersinia pestis, responsible for the deadliest pandemic in human history that killed between 75 and 200 million between 1346 and 1353.  However, there is evidence thatY. pestiswas present as early as 3000-3500 BC, with its first recorded pandemic occurring sometime between 550 and 750.  Therefore, the rapid pace at which knowledge accumulation of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 is occurring is unprecedented, and truly unbelievable.  Despite this, there are many aspects that we don’t know, and that lack of understanding contributes, no doubt, to the continued rapid spread of this disease .It is clear that COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease and that SARS-Cov-2 is primarily a respiratory virus.  Indeed, this viruses name shows how closely related it is to the virus responsible for the SARS epidemic nearly 20 years ago.  Despite these undeniable facts, there are a range of other symptoms and clinical presentations that have been reported (Figure 1), other than the standard fever, dry cough, headache, breathing difficulty etc.  Some of these include gastrointestinal involvement (Linet al., 2020), continuing to fuel speculation over alternative route(s) of transmission.  I written two previous articles on this topic, here on this blog.Figure 1: COVID-19 can clinically present in several ways.The first one, titled “COVID-19: A likely foodborne disease“, written on March 15, was a theoretical speculation into if SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted person-to-person through food.  This could orginally be from respiratory secretions, or maybe even a faecal-oral route.  Considering that SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from wastewater (Ahmedet al., 2020) and the virus has been detected in patient’s faeces up to five weeks after they become negative for SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al., 2020) the facecal-oral route (Figure 2) is a distinct possibility.Figure 2: How the faecal-oral route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission might occur.  Source: Heller et al. (2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138919Then on April 5, I delved into the how COVID-19 could be regarded as a gastrointestinal disease with the article titled “GastroCoronavirus“.  This was due to the various reported cases where gastrointestinal symptoms appeared first (Figure 3) and were dominant (Figure 4), and in some cases, were the only symptoms.Figure 3: Your COVID-19 symptom could be diarrhoea.Figure 4: Dominance of gastrointestinal symptoms in some COVID-19 patients.Most recently in my blog post published on August 17 titled “The global supply chain transmission possibility of SARS-CoV-2“, I discussed how it may be possible for SARS-CoV-2 to remain viable on frozen food or it’s packaging, long enough to transmit disease on the other side of the world.  This was raised as a possibility of how COVID-19 cases flared up again in New Zealand – the virus remained active on frozen food or its packaging while being shipped from Melbourne (the current epicentre of COVID-19 in Oceania) to Auckland.What sparked me to write another article on this topic area?  Basically a news story yesterday titled “Weird new symptom of COVID-19“, where a healthcare worker in Brisbane suspected from their gastrointestinal symptom (abdominal pain), that they may have been infected by SARS-CoV-2.  They got tested and their subscription was correct – positive!  What I want to point out is that while it is clearly atypical, it is not necessarily a “weird” symptom as the media described (Figure 5) it as – it, gastrointestinal symptoms, has been described before.  This of course raises speculation again whether COVID-19 is a foodborne disease, if the virus can remain active in food, packaging or environmental sources and indeed if a facial-oral transmission route does occur, as it does for many foodborne diseases.Figure 5: The news story which came out of Brisbane yesterday.Where does that leave us?  Despite government and health authorities continuing to state that COVID-19 is not a foodborne disease (Figure 6), I believe these facts warrant a reconsideration of such a conclusive statement.  The facts being:Some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 do develop gastrointestinal symptoms.  In such people, it is not uncommon for these symptoms to be dominant and to precede respiratory symptoms.SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated hardiness, remaining active on various surfaces and in various environments for prolonged periods.  This includes frozen drinks.SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from wastewater, suggesting that a facecal-oral route of transmission is not out of the question.SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from frozen food samples imported from a country many thousands of kilometres away.Figure 6: Official Twitter circulated information from the Government of South Australia in Adelaide.A foodborne route could be a valid transmission mechanism for SARS-CoV-2.  In fact, as early as 27 March 2020, the journalGutaccepted a commentary article for publication, where the authors concluded that the evidence for common occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms is accumulating (Ng & Tilg, 2020).   The fact that relatively few reports on this exist could be because it is substantially underreported because health and government authorities do not (wish too?) recognise that COVID-19 may be a foodborne disease.  This may be one factor contributing to its largely unchecked spread in some countries – people don’t recognise that foodborne transmission is possible, therefore they take few precautions in that regard and with few controls in place, virus transmission by that route continues almost unhindered.  Furthermore, when people have gastrointestinal symptoms, COVID-19 is probably the last thing they would think of.  What did I eat last night? a few days ago? etc., it’s rarely or never, “goodness me, I have such and such a gastrointestinal symptom, I might have COVID-19, let me get tested immediately”. This is just not something people would think.  Therefore, the spread of the disease might further spread, much more easily.  This would be especially so in countries with poor sanitation and hygiene, limited running water and a general lack of understanding or practices related to food safety and/or personal hygiene.So, just be a little more careful with your own practices of food safety and personal hygiene, that episode of “gastro” just may be your first symptom of COVID-19.ReferencesAhmed, W., Angel, N., Edson, J., Bibby, K., Bivins, A., O’Brien, J.W., Choi, P.M., Kitajima, M., Simpson, S.L., Li, J. and Tscharke, B., 2020.

A few weeks ago, I started moving our video content to our new Brand YouTube channel, with the first (and so far the only!) video on our channel being  on my career in food microbiology.  In fact, this video formed the basis of our vlog posted on May 24, which is located here:http://foodmicrobiology.academy/2020/05/24/my-food-microbiology-career/.So anyway, a few days ago my video was found by a (very) young aspiring food microbiologist in Mumbai, India.  This teenage student made some comments to initiate a conversation with my around career advice and guidance, then we continue our discussions through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.  Now, we’re about to formalise our discussions with a mentoring agreement.  This is just great news and of mutual benefit as she can clearly gain from my years on a non-traditional career path and I real feel like I’m ‘giving back’ and encouraging and ‘grooming’ the next generation of passionate food microbiologists to come along and really take on the challenges of the world and solve them, which we can all really achieve together.  This student is pretty amazing because even at her young age, she has a career vision and a firm goal of wanting to work in the area of food safety and foodborne diseases at the World Health Organization.  With such a plan at such an early age, she can so get there as well.  What I wanted this blog post to be was to introduce the career mentoring thatFood Microbiology Academynow offers by elaborating on some of the examples I provided to this mentee during our early discussions.Firstly, too many people, myself included years ago in the mid to late 1990s, have a general career idea but no firm goal and vision.  Without this, you do almost wander aimlessly to some extent.  Thus, I would say – don’t worry about or try and identify what you will study as your undergraduate degree and where until you have identified your dream job.  Then, you can work backwards.  Setting your dream job as your goal will help answer so many questions, such as:Which is the highest degree I’ll need?Do I need to do a Master degree?  if so, should it be a research or coursework Master degree?Which country should I complete my various degrees in?What should my undergraduate degree be in?What sort of opportunities should I seek during holidays or internships to support me reaching my career goal(s)?For example, if you have come to the conclusion that you need a PhD, does the Australian (three years, one laboratory, research only) or North American (four years, laboratory rotations during the first year, 25% coursework) model work better for you and your career.  Then, for training like a PhD, the importance of factors that you should consider can be ranked like this, from most important to least important: Supervisor > Laboratory > Department > University > Country.  Some people get to hung up over doing their PhD in a particular country or a particular university.  However, it is the supervisor that is most critical and I’m sure you can find exceptional academic supervisors leading world-class research groups engaging in cutting edge discoveries located in what many would consider sub-standard universities or lower ranking countries for research training or higher education in general.However, you may not even be at the stage where you can identify your ideal or dream job, but you just have a hankering for food microbiology.  In such case, perhaps consider the following, as a non-exhaustive list of careers in food microbiology that require high levels of responsibility, so senior positions that typical require a PhD:I)Teaching food microbiology in a college/university(professor in a community college).II)Doing food safety research in a university(research-only academic position, like Research Assistant Professor or Senior Research Fellow, in a research-intensive university).III)Teaching food microbiology and doing food safety research in a university(traditional academic position).IV)Doing food safety research and development in a food manufacturing company(only food manufacturing companies of substantial size, like Nestlé would engage in such R&D)V)Consulting and therefore providing advice to small and medium size food companies on keeping their products safe(either as an independent consultant or working for a scientific consulting firm).VI)Managing food safety at a large food manufacturing company(this may be part of a quality management role of if the food manufacturing operation is large enough, then it would be a seperate position).VII)Tracking foodborne diseases and identifying sources of outbreaks(such as at a government health organisation, which could be at a national level like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States or the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory in the Australian state of Victoria)VIII)Developing public health strategies and government policy to reduce foodborne disease(an advisory role in government to assemble scientific information and make recommendations for policy and legislative changes to protect the health of the citizens under the jurisdiction of the government you’re working for).So, if you’re a budding food microbiologist (no pun intended!) or simply want to find out more about careers and working in our field, do contact myself (Dr Philip Button, @pdbutton, by e-mail to philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academy).","career, career choice, food microbiologist, mentoring"
Food safety,"food-safety, food-spoilage",Teaching food microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/teaching-food-microbiology/,"July 26, 2020","^ Memories of teaching food microbiology at The University of Melbourne – with some of my undergraduate students near the end of second semester in 2008.We are (re)launching our academic support services (Figure 1), which include tutoring and guidance for research students.  It therefore seemed appropriate at this stage that I share my teaching philosophy, so basically how I approach teaching of food microbiology.  Without any further ado, here is my teaching philosophy.Figure 1: Food Microbiology Academy’s tutoring and academic support.Teaching is a passion for me. I thoroughly enjoy contributing to students’ acquisition of knowledge and feel truly satisfied when they have really understand a topic or even a concept.My main area of teaching focus is microbiology, particularly in food and industrial microbiology.  However, I am able and very much willing to teach a diversity of courses in different areas of microbiology, immunology, pathology or biochemistry, for example.It is imperative to ensure that material presented is relevant to what is currently practiced in industry or in a research setting. Therefore, the course content I deliver is always up to date with present trends, methodologies and thinking. For example, in 2011, I overhauled the advanced undergraduate level Food and Industrial Microbiology course I was co-ordinating at Monash University, to ensure the lectures included coverage of rapid, molecular identification techniques (among other alternative approaches to microbial identification) in addition to the diversity of non-thermal processing methods, some of which were in commercial use already.I am a strong believer of problem based learning teaching methods, but acknowledge that this approach isn’t suited to all topics and subject areas. In those cases, I would use the traditional lecture format to deliver the basic concepts and then use problem based learning to reinforce the fundamental knowledge. I feel this is particularly suited to food microbiology (but not general microbiology) and food processing/manufacturing technology. Related to this approach, I also like to try and teach from original research papers on a particular topic, especially when considering foodborne disease outbreaks or incidents of food spoilage. Using this approach previously, I have allocated a particular research paper to a small group of students and asked them to read it and present relevant details (according to a specified set of questions) to the class – a short discussion session follows presentation of each paper.  To enable students to consolidate their newly acquired theoretical knowledge, I believe that the theoretical material for a practical class must be presented in the week of the practical class. To ensure this, I would carefully structure a course so that students gain benefit from this. Furthermore in practical classes, unless all students are given the opportunity for “hands on” experiences, holding practical classes is pointless. This is because, to me, practical classes are the times when all students must have the opportunity to get close to the real science and the real technology and actually do it.  Therefore, I would carefully consider the type of exercise, class scheduling and class numbers to guarantee the effective learning experience of all students.I believe that group work has a place in tertiary education today, but consider that it is an area that isn’t a high priority. In my opinion, students must be able to work on their own first and recognise their own strengths and weaknesses and be competent independent workers, so that they can contribute fairly to group work. Therefore, it would be important to incorporate group work for a “taste” of what is to come in the workplace, but to ensure a system such that group work is not assessed solely on the product, but that some weighting is given to the process as well.There is no point in teaching without determining how effective the teaching is. Formal course evaluations of teaching quality provide an indication as to the general areas where improvement is best directed. However, I enjoy casual interactions with students after class and during practical sessions as this is when I can really gauge their understanding of the material and provide direct and personalised information to a particular student to fill a deficiency in their knowledge. I also value the use of practice exams, to gain an honest assessment of where the students are with the material, both individually and as a class.","food microbiology, teaching, teaching philosophy, university"
Food safety,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",How to preserve food with ozone,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/how-to-preserve-food-with-ozone/,"July 22, 2020","Heat treatment of food was a marvellous public health revolution.  It enabled safe food to last longer and was an advancement from the early preservation methods of salting, smoking and the like.  Despite the many advantages of thermal treatment of food, there are of course detrimental effects.  For many decades, the advantages of heat preserving food outweighed the disadvantages.  However, in the past 20-30 years, many non-thermal food processing technologies have emerged as commercially viable.  This is despite many of these actually old technologies.  One such technology is ozonation.  Many technological advancements have enabled a wide range of different approaches to food preservation to come to the fore, another important reason is consumer-driven.  That reason is indeed a driver of food trends and the fact that consumers increasingly want minimally processed foods that represent a ‘clean and green’ approach of sourcing and processing.Ozone is another food processing technology that tends to be referred to as ’emerging’ or ‘innovative’ when in fact it is old technology.  It is reported to have been first used for water treatment in 1893, in the Netherlands, and for food (meat) preservation in 1909, in Germany.  Just to be clear at this stage that ozone is a gas, O3, which has one additional oxygen atom compared to molecules of oxygen, O2.What can ozone be used for?It has wide applications in the food industry (Figure 1), and not only in food preservation:Ensuring microbiological safety of foods.Prevention of spoilage and extending shelf-life.Disinfection of water supplies.Sanitisation of surfaces in food manufacturing facilities (Figure 2).Eliminating odours in food.Reducing the residual pesticides remaining on fresh produce.Figure 1: Applications of ozone in the food sector.Figure 2: How ozonated water can be used in food processing plants.What foods can ozone be used with/on?It’s more what foods that ozone is NOT compatible with!  Ozone is very versatile indeed and can be used with these foods or types of products:Fresh or frozen foods.Fruits and vegetables.Red meat, poultry and seafood.Dairy foods.Spices.Beverages.Nuts.How is ozone formed?For ozone to form, air or ideally pure oxygen (for a higher yield when actually generating ozone) is necessary as the starting point (Figure 3) (Step 1).  Energy is then required to split the oxygen molecule into individual atoms.  This energy more often comes in the form of a corona discharge (Step 2).  Once oxygen atoms are available, they are free to bond with any oxygen molecules that have not split, which forms ozone (Step 3).  During its action, one of the oxygen atoms from the ozone molecule splits off  (Step 4) and you have an oxygen molecule remaining (Step 5).  This is another big advantage of this technology, no toxic/harmful end products, just simple and human-life-sustaining oxygen molecules.Figure 3: Formation of ozone.How is ozone generated?The above paragraph outlines about how ozone is actually formed, but how about its actual commercial generation?  As mentioned previously generation using energy from corona discharge is more common, as can be seen in Figure 4.  At the start of the process we have oxygen molecules entering the system, either as air or pure oxygen.  A fan blows the gas to the part of the unit where the high voltage corona discharge provides energy for disruption of the oxygen molecules to make individual oxygen atoms available.  These oxygen atoms combine with oxygen molecules to form ozone.Figure 4: Corona discharge ozone generation.How can ozone be applied to food, water or surfaces?In either aqueous or gaseous forms.  Where possible, the gaseous form would be preferred due to increased stability of the ozone compared to the aqueous form.  These diagrams show the process of treating food with ozone.  In each case, note that an ozone generator close by the treatment area is mandatory, due to the stability of ozone, even in the gaseous phase.  In Figure 5 we have an example of how ozone can be applied to food when the ozone is diffused in water.  To start the process the oxygen is concentrated before entering the generation unit.  Next is the treatment chamber, where the generated ozone is physically combined with water, by one or two techniques, either venturi injection or fine bubble diffusion.  Due to instability, immediate use of the ozonated water is a must.Figure 5: How ozone is generated and applied in aqueous form.With the application of gaseous ozone to food, Figure 6 shows this process, where you have air or pure oxygen flowing into ozone generation unit, which then enters the treatment chamber for the gaseous treatment of the food.  Now, although ozone degrades to oxygen gas after use, it is very important to be aware that ozone is a harmful gas, as a respiratory irritant at low concentrations or at high concentrations it can be fatal.  Thus, monitoring of the amount of residual ozone remaining after treatment is necessary, then the passage of this output gas through an ozone destructor is required to ensure that no ozone remains and is emitted into the processing environment.Figure 6: How ozone is generated and applied in gaseous form.This is an overview of the technology, what it can be used for and how to use it.",
Food safety,"food-quality, food-safety",Food irradiation is safe!,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-irradiation-is-safe/,"July 13, 2020","Originally written by Jill Koh in April 2010.Second review and minor revisions by Philip Button in July 2020.History of food preservation can be traced back many, many decades ago, with various processing methods such as canning, pasteurisation, and flash freezing. Food irradiation is a newer method of food preservation which is increasingly employed by food manufacturers to complement existing technologies due to the number of beneficial effects on foods (“Food Irradiation,” 1994). The process calls for controlled exposure of foods to a source of ionising radiation energy under specific environmental conditions (usually gamma rays and electron beams – Figure 1) at adequate levels to produce the desired result, yet avoiding degradation of the product (“Food Irradiation,” 1994).Figure 1: Some forms of ionising radiation.A unique advantage of irradiation is its strong penetrative power. Foods can be treated in their final packaging with only a slight increase in temperature, thus avoiding the possibility of recontamination (Henson, 1995). Furthermore, the three forms of radiation (radappertization, radicidation, and radurization, differentiated by radiation dosage) (Figure 2) were found to be effective in enhancing keeping quality of foods, and were quickly adapted by meat manufacturers to eliminateTrichinella spirallisin meat (Henson, 1995).Figure 2: Forms of radiation in the treatment of food.As shown above, the benefits of food irradiation to known causes is established- sterilization and control of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria in foods are the primary objectives; while delay of ripening and sprouting hindrance in fruits and vegetables enable these commodities to have a long shelf-life (“Food Irradiation,” 1994). It was reported that sprouting in root crops can be inhibited at low irradiation doses of 0.05-0.15 kGy (“Food Irradiation,” 1994) (Figure 3). In another study, the use of gamma ray irradiation up to 10 kGy on beef sausage patties reduced bacterial populations with no adverse effect on quality and sensory characteristics (Park, et al., 2010). These had led to a huge leap in quantity of irradiated foods with 405 000 ton produced globally (Kume, Furuta, Todoriki, Uenoyama, & Kobayashi, 2009).Figure 3: Effect of food irradiation treatment of spouting of potatoes during shelf-life.As with all new food processes, food irradiation has generated criticism from health experts due to potential health risks and conflicting evidence on the effects and safety of irradiated foods (Diehl, 2002; Louria, 2000). Acceptance of irradiated foods is not uniform globally; with Japan and United States embracing the technology while progress in the European Union is slow (Diehl, 2002; Kume, et al., 2009). Moreover, the regulation of irradiated foods in different countries are not standardized, hence resulting in difficulty to assess the nutritional content and safety of irradiated food products (Diehl, 2002).  However, as of 2010, food irradiation is approved in over 55 countries (Junqueira-Gonçalveset al., 2011), which is certainly promising for its widespread commercial use.Public opinion on irradiated foods was considered positive during the growth of nuclear technology in 1950 (Diehl, 2002). However, the climate of consumer views changed with the progress of anti-nuclear movement and increased knowledge of health and nutrition (Figure 4). To counteract this phenomenon, a study group on High Dose Irradiation examined the results of safety studies on foods irradiated with doses higher than 10 kGy in 1997 (Diehl, 2002). It was concluded that few foods withstand doses above 10 kGy without sensory quality loss. Also, a study on animals fed with foods irradiated up to 70 kGy showed no adverse health effects. Thus, the study group concluded that foods irradiated to achieve intended technological purposes are both safe and nutritionally satisfactory (Diehl, 2002). In Australia, a study conducted found no significant changes in fatty acid compositions of Black Bream and Redfish after gamma-irradiation treatment of up to three times the recommended dosage, albeit vitamin E loss remained uncertain (Armstrong, Wyllie, & Leach, 1994).Figure 4: Consumers perception of irradiated foods.Despite reassurance on non-toxicity and radioactivity in irradiated foods by governmental and health authorities, major concerns remain on the safety and nutritional adequacy of irradiated foods due to conflicting results and conclusions made by opposing parties (“Food Irradiation,” 1994) (Figure 5). Fears of carcinogenic food from irradiation that leads to DNA damage was suggested in a human study that found chromosomal breaks in malnourished children fed with irradiated wheat (Louria, 2000). The findings were consistent in another experiment when irradiated wheat was fed to monkeys and rats (Tritsch, 2000). In addition, irradiation was found to destroy some vitamins, such as loss of thiamin content in irradiated pork (Louria, 2000); and reduced level of vitamin E in irradiated rolled oats (“Food Irradiation,” 1994). Furthermore, it was reported by Tritsch (2000) that the number of bacteria increased exponentially during cold storage of irradiated fish fillet, implying division of all cells and progeny produced. Bacterial contamination of the fish fillets equaled that of non-irradiated fillets upon additional 14 days of storage. It was also suggested that the new population of bacteria are more radiation resistant than the original population. Lastly, the most radiation-resistant organism,Deinococcus radiouranswas isolated from irradiated canned meat (Tritsch, 2000). These food scares has led to proposition by consumer groups the possibility of food irradiation employment to conceal bad manufacturing practices (Henson, 1995).Figure 5: Some consumers’ perception of irradiated food.As demonstrated above, food irradiation remains a controversial issue with many barriers to overcome before gaining support from consumers and opposition parties for widespread use. To aid this process, (Louria, 2000) has proposed testing of irradiated foods by external parties with full disclosure of results placed on the label of the final product. Another issue to address is the lack of confidence in the process of scientific approval of food irradiation. Although irradiation of meat requires prior approval by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS), consumers are still suspicious of the regulatory process itself due to loss of trust in both the government and administrative agencies (Henson, 1995). A good example is the UK government’s failure to warn consumers of the mycotoxin patulin in fruit juice which heightened consumer suspicions over the motives of food regulators (Henson, 1995). Another alternative is to market irradiated foods at selected consumer groups least sensitive to the technology. A striking observation was that irradiated foods sold very well to consumers who accept food irradiation (Henon, 1995; Henson, 1995). However, the most effective strategy in the long term would be to change consumer perception towards the technology. Existing attempts to promote the benefits of food irradiation have met with limited success due to the absence of solid evidence on the safety of irradiated foods (Henson, 1995). Consequently, it is important for authorities to promote food irradiation based on greater understanding of consumer concerns, social and cultural values to speed up adoption of the technology.References:Armstrong, S.

Food safety,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",Please listen to the scientists!,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/please-listen-to-the-scientists/,"July 3, 2020","What people want drives change.  Throughout history we have seen this and even most recently, or should I say currently, the overwhelming wants of many in society have seen protests and rallies the world over for Black Lives Matter, despite the very real dangers from the surging COVID-19 pandemic.  In just a matter of weeks, this has become a real global movement with rapid change occurring that one would not have thought possible a couple of months ago.  Thus, it is people and society that are drivers of change.  If a voice is loud enough, and/or persistent enough, it will be heard.  I didn’t intend this blog post to be an information piece on sociology, but wanted to highlight how powerful voices can be as drivers of reform, policy change and indeed even ideological foundations.  Therefore, we can see that people are able to lead change and drive change in so many areas.Food is a big one in this regard.  Food is a major part of culture and identity, plus it is an integral part of daily life.  As a result of these reasons, many people tend to have quite strong views or opinions with regard to food.  It is these views or opinions, if held by enough people, can become food trends, drivers of change to the food supply.  So many people are under the misconception that food manufacturers are using processing technologies or ingredients purely for their own benefit and without regard for consumers.  This is not true, and here’s why.  Food manufacturers are dependent on sales of their products for survival of their business.  If they do not take into consideration what consumers want or don’t want, they are then directly harming their business.  Think about it – consumers have a preference, for example, against artificial chemical preservatives in food, but if a food manufacturer loads a food with ten such preservatives to give that food a super/ultra long shelf-life to enable wide distribution to reach distant markets, what will actually happen?  Consumers will avoid that product, sales will drop and that food manufacturer will financially suffer.  It’s pretty clear-cut.  Therefore, it is in the food manufacturer’s best interests to give consumers what they want – such as minimal processing or preservative-free foods, for example.  To be clear about this – it is consumers which drive food trends, with food manufacturers merely responding to these food trends that consumers are creating with their preferences.Ok, so what is actually trending in my expertise area of food preservation?  Consumers are after natural, ‘clean and green’ (Figure 1) and desire quality food.  Food quality is more than non-spoiled food these days.Figure 1: Ways to eat ‘clean’.Quality of food tends to also refer to high in (original) taste along with minimal nutritional deterioration.  These reflect the ‘natural’ aspect of food.  Marry consumers’ interests with the long shelf-life desired by food manufacturers, and you have what might seem an impossible situation … combining a long shelf-life without the traditional approach to food preservation using chemical preservatives.  So how can we do this?  Well, it’s my intention here to just raise the names of the plethora of alternative processing technologies either in use or under various stages of development – such as:High pressure processingPulsed electric fieldIonising radiationOhmic heatingRadio frequencyMicrowavesUltrasoundUltraviolet lightInfrared heatingOzone (Figure 2)Supercritical carbon dioxidePower ultrasoundsCold plasma (Figure 3)Electrolysed waterHigh voltage arc dischargePulsed lightFigure 2: An industrial scale ozone-based fruit disinfection system.Figure 3: Benefits of cold plasma for eliminating fungi and mycotoxins from food.In many, or should I say most, foods to be processed, heat is still the best option.  It could be due to effectiveness in ensuring a safe product or a prolonged shelf-life, financial considerations or consumer perception of the new technology.  One aspect is certain though, there is a desire to move away from thermal processing.  While it has many benefits with regard to its effective elimination or reduction of microorganisms, there are a whole range of detrimental effects of heat on product quality, which consumers are increasing not willing to tolerate.  The tough aspect can be to find an alternative that is I) financially viable for the manufacturer, II) addresses safety requirements set by government authorities, III) enable an appropriately long shelf-life, IV) improves or at least maintains quality (sensory and nutritional) quality of the product and V) is accepted by consumers.  Unfortunately, sometimes the (very) loud voices of a (very) small minority of radical opponents to a new technology drown out the scientists attempting to speak the truth about a new technology.  This can lead to very delayed introduction sometimes of an effective and safe technology.  Such a scenario should not be allowed to stay in the way of the progress of humanity, which unfortunately it has many a time.  Just look at ionising radiation in food preservation, also known as food irradiation or GM foods.  Both are demonstrated to be extremely safe, yet there is strong public opposition (Figure 4) despite benefits for food preservation and wastage (Figure 5) and for the environment (Figure 6).  Opposition based on what? …when the science says it is safe, yet these radical minorities cling to a myth of hope that might come true one day, and devalue the work of the world’s great scientists in essentially endorsing the safety of these technologies.  Come on everyone, keep a level head and please listen to the scientists, for all our sakes!Figure 4: Public perception of the agricultural and food manufacturing industry.Figure 5: Preventing apple spoilage with GM.Figure 6: How GM crops benefits the environment.","food preservation, food science, frankenfood, gm foods, gmo"
Food safety,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",Safety of sodium benzoate (E211),https://foodmicrobiology.academy/safety-of-sodium-benzoate-e211/,"June 15, 2020","Originally written byJill Kohin 2010.  Reviewed, revised and updated byPhilip Buttonin 2020.Sodium benzoate has sparked public health concern due to the discovery of the carcinogenic chemical benzene (Figure 1) in soft drinks (Food and Drug Administration, 2007; Food Standards Agency, 2006). Benzene is a known carcinogen “by all routes of exposure” (Ibolyaet al., 2012) and is present in the atmosphere from exhaust emissions (220 μg) and cigarette smoke (7900 μg) (Figure 2). Benzene levels have only been regulated in drinking water with an upper limit of 5 ppb in the USA (Food and Drug Administration, 2007), or 10 μg/kg in UK (Food Standards Agency, 2006). An early study in 1993 reported that formation of benzene in soft drinks is attributed to the decarboxylation of benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid and transition metals naturally occurring in water (Gardner & Lawrence, 1993). In addition, elevated temperatures and light can stimulate benzene formation under the conditions above which render soft drinks to be a significant source of benzene (Food and Drug Administration, 2007).Figure 1: Benzene is carcinogenic.Figure 2: There are various sources of benzene exposure in everyday activities.The FDA has since initiated a survey on benzene levels in soft drinks and other beverages and found 9 out of 200 beverage products with benzene levels above 5 ppb. The respective manufacturers voluntarily reformulated the products and recent testing reported benzene levels in these products were less than 1.5 ppb. On the other hand, the FDA also conducted tests on 150 drinks with 4 products containing benzene levels above the allowed 10 μg/kg limit.  As such, all 4 products were recalled from the market. In its latest update the FDA has assured the public that it is working closely with the beverage industry to ensure benzene levels are minimized or eliminated where possible.  One way this could be achieved, while prolonging shelf-life at the same time, is through use of the natural additives nisin and natamycin (Garavagliaet al., 2019) which reduced microbial counts and reduced the formation of benzene.  The FDA has also reassured the public that sodium benzoate is still a safe preservative at a daily intake of <0.5g. This is because the body excretes benzoic acid in the urine as hippuric acid (Figure 3), leaving no accumulation of benzoic acid in the body (Belitz, Grosch, & Schieberle, 2009).Figure 3: Conversion of benzoic acid into hippuric acid.Another health concern related to sodium benzoate is the potential effect of causing hyperactivity in children. McCann et al. (2007) conducted an experiment to study the effects of artificial food colour and additives on childhood behaviour and concluded that consumption of foods with sodium benzoate or in combination with artificial colours resulted in increased hyperactivity in 3 year old and 8/9 year old children. However, the results were criticized by other professionals as inconclusive because there were observation of high sensitivity of the food additives in some hyperactive children, while others were unresponsive to the additives (Eigenmann & Haenggeli, 2007). In addition, another study reported that exposure to food additives such as sodium benzoate in children and teenagers rarely reach levels that link food additives and hyperactivity (Connolly, et al., 2010). Hence, further research is needed to establish the link between food additives and hyperactivity in adolescents due to conflicting results shown above.Based on the evidences outlined above, further investigation needs to be carried out to ascertain the side effects of sodium benzoate on human health as results from studies remain inconclusive. However, the food industry is aware of growing consumer concerns on the usage of chemical processing aids in food products and is seeking potential alternatives. One such effort is the development of mathematical models describing growth/no growth boundaries of a highly resistant food spoilage yeast-Z. bailiito aid formulation of shelf-stable foods without inclusion of chemical preservatives (Dang, et al., 2010).The benefits of sodium benzoate as a preservative cannot be denied and have been successfully used in various food applications. Sodium benzoate, on its own, has not been found to have any adverse effect on human health when consumed at maximum level of 4 g/day. Therefore, until concrete results on negative effects on human health have been established, concerned consumers may avoid intake of sodium benzoate by eliminating foods containing the chemical from their diet.  However, considering the facts about sodium benzoate (Figure 4) and the very low chance of exposure benzene from food compared with other sources, elimination of sodium benzoate from the diet is not recommended.Figure 4: Summary of facts about sodium benzoate.ReferencesBelitz, H.

Food safety,"food-quality, food-safety, fungi",Spoiled retail chicken.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/spoiled-retail-chicken/,"May 27, 2020","Woolworths responds after shopper’s ‘absolutely disgusting’ find in chicken — 7NEWS.com.auAs a food microbiologist specialising in food safety, food spoilage, food quality and food preservation, this recent news report (link above) from earlier this month was of particular interest to me.  First of all, I want to provide a response to four particular parts of that news story, then give a general commentary from my perspective.Posting photos appearing to show the mould spots to Facebook, James says he was lucky to spot the problem with the chicken – which was still well within the “best before” period – before eating it.Initially when I saw this reference to a “Best Before” date, I assumed the consumer had got expiry dates mixed up and he actually meant “Use By”, because I understand there is still a great degree of confusion amongst consumers regarding expiry dates on food.  So, in any case, this news story has a photo of the chicken packet and indeed, the expiry date is “Best Before”.  This leads me to ask, why is it a “Best Before” date and not a “Use By” date?  There are major differences between these two expiry dates with “Best Before” dates referring to product quality as impacted by food spoilage while “Use By” dates refer to product safety (Figure 1).  A product has its best quality guaranteed up to the “Best Before” date, after which date it is still safe to consume, but there may be some quality deviation from what consumers expect.  For example in colour or texture.  However,  “Use By’ dates refer to food safety considerations.  After the “Use By” date, food should not be consumed as its safety is not guaranteed.  Chicken is one of the foods, maybe the number food, that has the highest contamination potential from a food safety perspective.  Campylobacter and Salmonella are often seen in the top two microorganisms responsible for foodborne disease, in many countries … and which food(s) are typically vehicles of transmission?  Poultry and poultry products.  Thus, chicken is very much a potential food safety hazard, and it should have a “Use By” date rather than a “Best Before date”.Figure 1: The difference between Use By and Best Before.2.“The mould has been growing for at least a couple of days and it still had two days until the expiry date!I’m sorry, but is this guy a mycologist or a general microbiologist?  How does he know it had been growing for “at least a couple of days” when the product was stored at refrigeration temperature?  I can tell you, if mould spores germinated at refrigeration temperature, you certainly would not see any visible (not to the naked human eye anyway!) growth.  After two days, growth would still be microscopic.  It just amuses me when someone from the general public, who doesn’t know bacteria from mould and thinks you can get sick from growth of food spoilage microorganisms, makes comments like this.3. “Maybe the product was not handled or stored properly (not refrigerated correctly either during transport or once arriving to the store maybe?) which caused the bacteria/mould to grow, which again means the product should not have been sold.This is what I mean where he doesn’t know whether he has seen bacterial growth or mould growth.  Then, trying to identify where in the supply chain the cold chain was broken.  Just stick to the facts and not dramatise it all and don’t try to point fingers when you don’t know where to point them.4.“If myself and my family had eaten this we could have gotten very sick, and that is not good enough. We expect better.”…and here, I leave the best one until last!  He thinks they could have become sick from consuming some (minor) spoiled food.  If it is common for the general public to think that they can become sick from eating spoiled food, then we have a big issue on our hands of trying to bust some pretty big myths.  For the record, let it be known that spoiled food is generally speaking, safe to eat – I have no problem with eating a small amount of mouldy food for example.  While it might be safe to eat, the main issue will be based on quality, as the food may be unpalatable.  Just think, if foodborne disease was caused by spoiled food, then foodborne disease would rarely occur, right?  However it doesn’t.  Foodborne disease is caused pathogenic microorganisms that have grown in or on a food without causing detectable changes to the food.  This is why and how it is so easy to come down with a foodborne disease, because we just don’t know when we might consume an infectious dose of pathogenic microorganisms!Overall, I think this has just highlighted the degree of scientific literacy in Australian society.  Clearly, as food science professionals, we have some work to do in the area of public awareness.  One undervalued area in food science and technology is its crossover with supply chain management and logistics.  Many people I feel, just cannot appreciate the complexities of modern agrifood supply chains (Figure 2).  People at each and every step of the often long and involved agrifood supply chain for a given product are doing there best, and unfortunately, once in a blue moon, a mishap occurs.  Now, that is no reason to ‘crucify’ someone over this.  This is especially so when one consider the impeccable food safety and food spoilage record of primary producers, logistics and retailers and that spoilage of food and safety breaches are more likely to occur in the domestic environment, yes, carelessness in our homes is more likely to result in spoiled food, wasted food and foodborne disease due to cross-contamination and temperature control.Figure 2: An example agrifood supply chain.","chicken, consumers, food microbiology, food spoilage, retail"
Food safety,"bacteria, food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",My food microbiology career,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/my-food-microbiology-career/,"May 24, 2020","Here I venture into a combination approach, with traditional text and video in this first vlog post, covering my career as a food microbiologist.I’m doing a bit of a focus on careers in food microbiology, with my last blog article on this topic and now this one, where I combining the written blog approach with the vlog approach.  My previous blog post introduced the prominence and significance of microbiologists in the world, and thus as a career, before a short description of the areas of food safety, food spoilage/quality and gut health/probiotics and fermented foods.  I then detailed a career Q&A with a food safety auditor from Taipei.  In this video, I ask myself the same questions and show the path I’ve taken to become a food microbiologist.What I didn’t mention is that in 1994, while I was starting my Bachelor degree-level training in biology at Deakin University, I completed a vocational certificate-level course in horticulture, at the then Townsville College of TAFE.  So I’m a qualified horticulturist as well!However, I started as a microbiologist, with my initial training in that area being clinical microbiology with a veterinary emphasis before I gravitated to the wonders of food microbiology in the 3rd-year of my undergraduate degree at James Cook University.  I then continued in food microbiology – working on inducible acid tolerance of foodborne disease bacteria (in salad dressing and yogurt) for my Honours research at the then University of Ballarat, bacterial iron acquisition systems which enable them to spoil refrigerated pork exported to Asian markets for my MSc research at La Trobe University and for my PhD at The University of Melbourne and CSIRO, I investigated aspects of dairy product quality.  Specifically, I characterised the spoilage process of UHT milk with regard to the free amino acids and peptides that are liberated along with free fatty acids, as a result of the residual proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes that remain in the product following UHT treatment (2-4 seconds and around 140 degrees C).  I refined existing protease assays, increasing their sensitivity such that they could be used to better predict the onset of enzymatic-based spoilage in UHT milk.  Essentially therefore, my PhD project was in the area of biochemistry, specifically in enzymology and protein chemistry.For my postdoctoral work, I went to RMIT University where I worked in the Kasapis laboratory, gaining valuable research understanding and technical technical skills in the broad areas of physical chemistry and materials science, especially in relation to the use of carbohydrate polymers and protein in food systems and understanding how application of physical parameters may alter their molecular properties, thus altering their texture, mouthfeel and how they behave as ingredients in food products.  I was primarily using techniques of rheology and (differential scanning) calorimetry.  Following my postdoctoral position, I moved within RMIT University from what was then the School of Applied Sciences to the School of Business IT and Logistics where I contributed to projects in food composition databases, e-commerce and related areas of improving the consumer customer through innovative retailing solutions.Now, as an independent and freelance food microbiologist, I operate my own non-affiliated organisation called Food Microbiology Academy.  I offer services in consulting to the food manufacturing industry worldwide (both to start-ups and established food manufacturing enterprises), academic support (tutoring, research services, teaching) as well as contract and collaborative research – all of these primarily in my core expertise areas of food safety, food spoilage, food preservation and shelf-life extension.","career choice, food microbiologist, food microbiology, food science"

Therefore, there’s no doubt that microbiologists are particularly valuable at the moment.  Especially virologists and those microbiologists that have an understanding of infectious diseases, public health and/or epidemiology.  Plus, some knowledge of immunology can be helpful to for vaccine development as can pharmacology for drug development.  However, it’s really the microbiologists that are coming to the fore.  People talk about ‘saving the world’ and about the impact and importance of careers, but microbiologists really can save the world.  If you had any doubt about the importance of a career in microbiology, then just consider what is happening in the world now and what has happened since December.  …and we’re not just talking about personal and public health, but livelihoods and the global economy.  The economy has gone ‘pear-shaped’ because of a microbiological phenomenon, something that could be stopped by microbiologists, if they are, or were given the opportunity.  The power is in the hands of microbiologists and those with an intricate understanding of microbiology, to save the world, I have no doubt about that.  So, if you want a powerful career, an impactful career, a highly significant career, then consider microbiology!A FOOD MICROBIOLOGY CAREERHow about a career in food microbiology?  What might that look like and what might one be involved with?  Well even in food microbiology there are many varied areas to work in.  The three key areas are: i) food safety, ii) food spoilage/food quality and iii) fermented foods, probiotics and gut health.  Each of these has highly significant impacts on society and on the economy.  Let’s look at each of these in more detail.What is food safety?Food safety is all about ensuring the safety of the food supply.  This means monitoring, auditing, regulating and developing policy for the purposes of safeguarding raw materials and manufactured food over the entire agrifood supply chain from ‘farm to fork’ or ‘paddock to plate’ as the concept goes.  Food safety microbiologists closely associate with epidemiologists, public health professionals and infectious disease experts to combat prevention, tracking and limiting the spread of foodborne diseases of epidemic proportions.What is food spoilage and food quality?Spoilage and subsequent wastage of food results in substantial economic losses.  In countries with developing economies, such spoilage and waste of food is more likely to be fresh produce and thus postharvest and pre-manufacure losses.  In countries with advanced economies, the situation is quite different, with substantial spoilage and waste taking place at the consumer level.  Tight supply chains along with excellent mechanisms of food preservation mean that spoilage losses in such countries are at a minimum.What are fermented foods, probiotics and gut health?This area is closely linked with personal health and wellness.  There is a sustained food trend in the area of probiotics as functional foods, along with prebiotics and people realise the great benefits of how one’s gut health contributes to overall health and wellbeing.  Related to this are fermented foods, many of which are probiotic, and as such, are rich natural sources of ‘good’ bacteria.CAREER PROFILE OF A FOOD MICROBIOLOGISTWondering how a career in food microbiology might actually look like in reality?  Well, I had a Q & A session with Lucy Lam, a food safety auditor from Taipei, Taiwan.  Let’s find out what Lucy’s food microbiology career looks like…What qualification(s) do you hold and from where?Master of Science, with a major in food, nutrition and technology, from The Chinese University of Hong KongBachelor of Food Science, from The University of MelbourneYour present position and where?Auditor, Bureau Veritas Certification  (Taiwan)How would you describe your career ‘in a nutshell’?A passion for food safety and quality control along with being good at problem solving. 1. Interest in manufacturing in any field, especially the food industry 2. Looking forward to opportunities to be involved more in food product development.Describe what you do you do on a day-to-day basis?As an auditor, I follow back office schedules to visit clients and conduct on-site audit. Before and after the audit, preparation of the report document is needed.How do you gain most satisfaction in your food microbiology career?When I gained the most hands-on experience in food microbiology when I was working in the food industry between 2013 – 2018. As I was a laboratory supervisor and department assistant manager, I had to oversee the operation of the laboratory including lab supplies, SOPs, good laboratory practices and third party laboratory compliances.What can you forsee as big challenges in your particular area of food microbiology?Food microbiology testing can be regarded as a quality control gate for product release and assurance in food industry. Hence the testing lead time will be demanding and tends to be “quick and accurate”. It is believed that rapid test kits or rapid test methods will be upcoming trends in food microbiology testing.Some advice about a career in food microbiology?It is suggested people who wish to be a food microbiologist must have basic food knowledge, and willing to do a lot of research and study.So there you have it, whether it’s building the health of individuals through improving gut health, ensuring public health is maintained through a safe food supply or curbing the substantial economic losses through food spoilage and food waste, there are multiple ways to save the world as a food microbiologist!

Food safety,"bacteria, food-safety, viruses",Putting COVID-19 and foodborne disease into perspective.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/putting-covid-19-and-foodborne-disease-into-perspective/,"February 21, 2020","There’s no doubt as to the seriousness of SARS-CoV-2 (the causal agent of COVID-19 disease), indeed this was highlighted by the World Health Organization giving this epidemic the status of aPublic Health Emergency of International Concern(PHEIC) on January 30 – you can read the minutes of the meeting where the declaration was made > (https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov).  However, hysteria aside, we need to put it into perspective.  As of today, there are 76 819 reported cases and 2 250 deaths – certainly serious by any measure.  This of course may be under reported and needs to be taken as a guide only.  Interestingly, this current global figure is similar to what the actual number of cases in Wuhan alone was predicted to be as at January 25, from the work of Wuet al.(2020), researchers from the The University of Hong Kong.  Therefore, from the “official” figures,  the crude calculation of case fatality rate (CFR) of this disease, which is currently at 2.5% needs to be taken very much as a guide only and treated with a great deal of caution.  While the total number of reported cases is clearly substantially greater than SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012 (Figure 1), it offers some (and I stress,some) guidance.  Whatever the situation turns out to be, the CFR rate is on the low side when compared with SARS and MERS (Figure 2), with younger healthy people rarely succumbing to the disease, meaning those that are in their senior years or immunocomprised in some way represent those that typically die from the COVID-19 disease.Figure 1: Comparison of the number of reported cases and reported deaths of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS and MERS.Figure 2: Case Fatality Rates (CFRs) of SARS in 2002/2003, MERS in 2012 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019/2020.An important epidemiological concept to consider is theBasic Reproduction Number, known as “R0”.  This number describes how quickly an infectious agent spreads, and is basically related to how many people one infected individual can infect.  An excellent article about this concept can be found here > (https://www.vox.com/2020/2/18/21142009/coronavirus-covid19-china-wuhan-deaths-pandemic).  The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is on the low side of the scale (although two to three fold higher than seasonal Influenza) (Figure 3) and if you do acquire the virus, chances of a complete recovery are extremely high.  This is especially so if you are in the 10-39 age group, where the CFR is just 0.2% (Figure 4, which shows data from mainland China – data outside of mainland China show even lower CFRs).  In practical terms, this means that if you are aged between 10 and 39, and contract the virus, you have a 99.8% chance of making a full recovery.  Yet there is great fear amongst people, people taking all kinds of extreme measures to avoid being near people they consider represent ‘typical’ cases of the disease, even in countries like Australia and the US.  This irrational behaviour is certainly not justified, especially when one considers other diseases, with high CFRs.  Thus, social isolation of particular cultural groups and types of businesses operated by these people are of great concern and impact to (initially) the local economy, but later on, regional and maybe the global economy.Figure 3: Basic Reproduction Number (R0) of various key human infective viruses.Figure 4: Indicative CFR from COVID-19 reported cases in mainland China.Anyway, as I saying, there are other diseases with much higher CFRs -take listeriosis for example.  The CFR for listeriosis tends to hover around 20% overall (Figure 5), and is especially of concern for pregnant women who, if infected in the second or third trimester, are likely to survive, but their fetus will have a mortality rate of around 45%.  While this disease is relatively rare, with only 65 cases reported in Australia per year, its high mortality rate warrants extra care regarding exercising preventative measures.  Of even greater concern would be infection withVibrio vulnificus, the CFR of which is typically between 35 and 50% overall (Hlady & Klontz, 1996; Leeet al., 2013), usually due to consumption of raw oysters (Figure 6).  Despite this scary statistic, raw oyster consumption (which is the main vehicle of transmission of these bacteria from their natural marine habitat to humans) has remained popular over the years as evidenced by the reported outbreaks (CDC, 1993; CDC, 1996).  In fact, people seem to be so keen to consume raw oysters that they stick to belief in various myths they believe can protect them from infection, such as hot sauce and/or lemon juice having a killing effect on the bacteria – this is so not true!  In fact, it is laughable, a very humorous myth indeed.Figure 5: Comparison of the outcome of infection with key foodborne pathogens.Figure 6: Another death from eating raw oysters, due toVibrio vulnificusinfection.So, am I suggesting or advocating to take a casual stance with regard to SARS-CoV-2?  Far from it – what I’m actually saying is put everything into perspective.  There are times when one needs to exercise extreme caution, even when it may not seem warranted and times when one can be rather casual.  For example, we must think broadly and not only about ourselves.  Someone may be young and strong with a top performing immune system, but if their circumstances/actions might put others who are vulnerable, potentially in a bad position health-wise, then we must take more precautions than we consider necessary for ourselves.  Take for example, the recent spike of COVID-19 cases in South Korea.  Tens of cases are linked to one person, who refused to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, and has infected many people.  Even if she was in a low risk demographic (which she wasn’t be the way, being of age 61), she needs to consider that if she is infected, might it be of public health concern? might she infect other people?  This is what I mean by putting it all into perspective, considering it on a case-by-case basis and acting accordingly to prevent the spread of the infectious agent and thus doing a favour for your fellow human beings.  This is what needs to be paramount in one’s mind amidst a global pandemic, which according to epidemiological projections, won’t peak until April (Wuet al., 2020).The point to be made here is that there is almost hysteria surrounding infection with SARS-CoV-2, but many people are rather blaise about other infections that are actually severe, with a high death rate – such asListeria monocytogenesandVibrio vulnificusdiscussed above.  Please think logically and clearly when making choices and taking actions regarding infectious disease, disease prevention and public health implications –one poor choice can start a global pandemic,that’s all it takes.ReferencesCDC/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

This disease has been postulated to have crossed, probably in late November 2019, from animals to humans at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (Figure 2) in Wuhan, China.  I say postulated, because there are more links between this market and early reported cases of the disease, than not.  In fact, 55% of all cases reported in 2019 (n = 425) had contact with the market (Liet al., 2020).  However, interestingly, the first reported case had no contact with this market.  Thus, an element of doubt exists regarding the degree of involvement of this market.  Anyway, this  huge ‘wet’ market comprises over 1 000 stalls and is a substantial trading area for a multitude of different species of animals, both live and dead.  Most of the trade is for food purposes, i.e. human consumption, but some are for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), where certain body parts of sometimes rare species are used for therapeutic purposes.Figure 1: What Coronaviruses look like.Figure 2: Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China.While the presence of this, or indeed other, viruses in animals sold as food doesn’t constitute a foodborne disease as such, in theory they could very well be a foodborne disease, in addition to their recognition as a zoonoses.  However, the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (2015) has stated that no direct evidence exists for foodborne transmission of the SARS Coronavirus or the H5N1 Influenza virus and that direct contact with animals is the likely means of transfer of these viruses from animals to humans.  Presumably this could be the situation with 2019-nCoV too?  However, Rodriguez-Morales (2020) states “the possibility of foodborne transmission from animal derived matter which has recently been highlighted to influence the current epidemic”.  Certainly, the potential for foodborne transmission is there but they would probably get stopped in their tracks, so to speak, during cooking, since viruses tend to be rather heat sensitive.Figure 3: Some bacterial zoonotic diseases.All this got me thinking and investigating online about zoonoses in general, and I was reminded that many, many diseases are in fact zoonotic (Figure 3).  I forgot that HIV/AIDS was (is?) a zoonoses that originated in a non-human source.  Many other common diseases, including recognised foodborne disease are zoonotic as well.  In fact, typically the two most common foodborne diseases in many parts of the world, infection fromCampylobacterand fromSalmonella, are considered zoonotic infections.  These of course, primarily originate from poultry flocks, with occurrence so widespread that it is safer to regard or poultry and poultry products (for example eggs) as contaminated, than non-contaminated.  Fortunately from the perspective of public health, these bacteria have low heat resistance and are easily eliminated by standard cooking procedures.  By and large, the same could be said for viruses present in animals as food sources.  However, while the temperature for viral inactivation might be similar to bacteria, they rate of inactivation is seen to be slower.  Therefore, a pasteurisation process may not be effective in eliminating viruses like it is for elimination of bacteria.Figure 4: Scene at a wet market in Wuhan, China.

All for only 17 RMB per kilo. Source: https://www.flickr.com/photos/cookiesound/9637285106Another aspect to consider is the complexities of managing the microbial or disease-free status of animals that are sold as food.  In western countries, where the palate might be regarded as simpler, a rather limited number of animal species are reared for food purposes.  The vast majority of animal meat consumed probably comes from a limited number of species, most of which are farmed (rather than wild caught) under tightly controlled and regulated agriculture or aquaculture environments.  This enables the farmer and government regulators to closely monitor disease status and in turn, act swiftly if something is amiss with regard to the health status of the animals which might post a threat to human health.  With such controls, regulation and monitoring in place, foodborne disease outbreaks still occur that can be traced back to primary production.  Imagine then, in a market where a myriad of animal species are sold – some alive and some dead, some wild-caught and some from small-scale family farms (Figures 4 and 5).  With less knowledge and less understanding of the disease status of the animals, the presence of asymptomatic infections and how to manage any risks, one would think this situation poses an almost insurmountable task with regard to personal safety, food safety and indeed public health.  For example, we just really don’t know what is going on with wild animal reservoirs of human disease (Figure 6) and indeed, the animal origins of human disease.  As we are not (and from a practical perspective, cannot do so) monitoring wild animal populations for their disease status, or asymptomatic infection status, we just don’t know what viruses, bacteria or protozoan parasites they are harbouring and how they are mutating and if and when they might cross the species barrier to other animal species or humans.Figure 6: Some animal reservoirs of some human diseases.It seems there are many sources of the problem, with Liet al.(2020) raising another when they state that positive attitudes towards the consumption of wild-caught game meat is at the root of the problem.  Regardless, I feel that this 2019-nCoV situation reminds us to be vigilant – there is much we don’t know about virulence and pathogenesis of infectious diseases and even when we have controls, monitoring and regulations in place, anything can still go amiss, simply because we’re dealing with an unpredictable dynamic biological system.  Therefore, as a global community let’s work together, let’s contribute together, let’s share together!ReferencesAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food Adhoc Group on Foodborne Viral Infections.

Food safety,"commentry, food-safety, history",The rule of microorganisms,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-rule-of-microorganisms/,"February 2, 2020","We are in a state of society or human civilisation where we are advancing faster than ever before – our creativity, our innovation and our progress seem to be boundless and what wasn’t even a thought not long ago is well on the to becoming reality (Figure 1).Figure 1: Human progress over the last 200 years.Take the last 50 years, back to 1970.  The difference in so many facets of the world is so vastly different between 1970 and 2020.  The same can’t be said for the progress made between 1870 and 1920, let alone say between 1370 an 1420.  With new fields of study and new professions rapidly emerging, society is advancing at an unprecedented rate.  Driverless cars, drones, artificial intelligence and 5G are revolutionising our world.  Despite these seemingly boundless gains in so many areas of human endeavour, we are in the midst of yet another disease pandemic.  Not “just another” pandemic, but a global pandemic (Figure 2), a global pandemic so serious that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current coronavirus pandemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (Figure 3).Figure 2: Global cases of the 2019-nCoV virus as of at 08:00 UTC on 1 February 2020.Figure 3: The 2019-nCoV global pandemic is a Public Health Emergency of International ConcernAs a global community, humankind can achieve so much and conquer nearly anything, it seems.  However, we are brought to our knees by a virus of just 100 nm in size, which converts to 0.0001 mm, which is unimaginably small.Figure 4: Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the 2019-nCoV virus.A virus, which like all viruses, lacks the ability to grow and replicate outside of a host cell – they hijack, if you like, the metabolic machinery of their host cell, which thus changes from maintaining and growing the host cell to simply growing and replicating new virus particles, or virions as they are called (Figure 5).Figure 5: The life of viruses.This all means viruses are not considered living and thus they are not considered lifeforms, because they don’t fulfil the basic criteria of life (Figure 6).  So, get your head around this, an entity that doesn’t fulfil the criteria to be called a form of life is striking fear into humanity, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality and crippling the economy, quite possibly the global economy.Figure 6: Requirements for life.As of 31 January 2020, Sarah Knapton reports in the Telegraph (1) that epidemiological modelling by The University of Hong Kong say around 75 000 people are estimated to be infected in Wuhan alone, with the size of the pandemic doubling every six days.  As of yesterday, 259 people are believed to have died from the infection with nearly 12 000 infected, officially, report Yeung and George on CNN (2).  The interesting aspect to consider, and what I really want to point out here is that disease epidemics and even global pandemics have been occurring for centuries (Figure 7).Figure 7: Just a handful of the epidemics and pandemics of the world.While the significance of the eradication of smallpox cannot be understated, especially considering that an estimated 500 million died from it between 1877 and the last known case in 1977, it seems that there are always diseases out there almost waiting to take the place of those which diminish in number of cases, or are eradicated, in the case of smallpox.  Like Spanish Flu, caused by an H1N1 influenza virus, killed between an estimated 50 000 000 and 100 000 000 between 1918 and 1920 or what is probably the most famous epidemic in history, the Black Death, caused byYersinia pestis, which killed an estimated 75 000 000 to 200 000 000 people between 1331 and 1353.  Even with recent foodborne diseases, there are still “records” being broken.  For example, theListeria monocytogenesoutbreak of 2017 and 2018 in South Africa was the largest in history, anywhere in the world, with 1 060 infected and 216 deaths.  Even cholera outbreaks continue to occur, and have been occurring for hundreds of years – the most recent and still ongoing is in Yemen where close to 4 000 people have died and around 1 200 000 cases reported since 2016.  Figure 8 shows the impact as of October 2017.Figure 8: Status of cholera in Yemen as of October 2017.Bacteria, or microorganisms that are not even living (viruses) have decimated humanity over millennia, and continue to do so.  All this, while we can do more in the current age than ever before, we are the most advanced, have made the most progress and an unprecedented rate is recent times, yet, infectious diseases still kill, and kill in such significance.  Why is it that non-living entities can have such sustained and significant impacts over the the most “superior” of all lifeforms, such an impact that humankind cannot conquer, as wave after wave of infectious diseases sweep the planet.  No doubt an interesting point to ponder.  Does that make microbiology the most important of all human endeavours?  Does that make microbiology worthy of increased attention?  Does that make microbiology worthy of increased resources?  If one wants to save the world, then the microbial world is a good place to start, and dare I say it, to end – such is the significance of microbiology to society and humankind, that maybe most (is it too bold to say all?) the problems of the world can be addressed and solved through microbiology.   So yes, who rules the world? People or microorganisms?  I’ll leave you with that thought.Referenceshttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/01/31/coronavirus-75000-people-infected-wuhan-experts-now-believe/https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-01-20-intl-hnk/index.html","coronaviridae, coronavirus, epidemic, food microbiology, microbiology, pandemic, pheic, virology"
food spoilage,"bacteria, food-spoilage",Intoxications versus infections,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/intoxications-versus-infections/,"April 25, 2022","How many times have your had a bout of ‘gastro’ and immediately cast your mind back to your last meal thinking, what did I eat?, how was it cooked?, what did I pick up in that meal that has made me sick?, and so on.  Well, to get straight to the point here, your last meal is highly unlikely to have given you a dose of foodborne disease.  Let me explain…Firstly, foodborne illness or gastrointestinal disease can be either an infection or an intoxication.  Now, you might be thinking, huh? an intoxication? I’m not intoxicated, I didn’t drink (alcohol) or don’t drink, what is this guy on about.  Well, an intoxication is simply any disease caused by a toxin.  The toxin can be alcohol, ethanol to be precise, or it can be a toxin produced by a toxigenic bacterium – one of the more common ones would beStaphylococcus aureus, which produces multiple heat-stable toxins that can cause gastrointestinal intoxications.  Let us delve deeper, and understand how foodborne intoxications occur.  A food product already contains the bacterium or is contained during preparation from the food handler.  This is an especially common means of food contamination withS. aureus, just because it is so common as a normal inhabitant of people’s skin and nose, for example.  So now we haveS. aureusbacteria on/in the food.  If the food is left under conditions that allow the bacteria to grow, they do so, and produce toxin.  At this point, the food may be heated, which kills off the bacteria.  However, the toxin is heat-stable, or at least more thermostable than the vegetative cells, and they remain in the food product even though the vegetative bacterial cells are eliminated by the heat treatment.  When someone eats this food, they are consuming the toxin, but not the bacteria that have been killed by the heat treatment.  The food handler may be secure in their action of heating the food, and the effect it has in a food safety sense.  However, they are doing little to render the food safe.  Toxin remains, enough toxin to cause an intoxication disease.  Not too long after someone consumes the food, perhaps four to six hours later, they get sick as they have been ‘poisoned’ by the toxin, they have been intoxicated.  In this case, the food they consumed at they last meal was almost certainly responsible for this foodborne illness, but it has to be an intoxication, due to the extremely short timeframe of just a few hours.Now, let us consider foodborne infections.  Infections are different from intoxications as these diseases result from the growth of microorganisms inside our body.  Picture this as a typical scenario: An ingredient is used in the preparation of a home-cooked dish, the cooking process results in an undercooked ingredient, we eat that undercooked ingredient and consume the bacteria, which could be a pretty small amount or a large amount, the bacteria grow inside our body and make us sick.  This is an infection.  A common example might be meat, chicken for example, which is invariably contaminated withCampylobacter jejuneorSalmonella enterica, for example, from cross-contamination during the slaughtering and processing procedure.  If this chicken is consumed undercooked, some or many of the bacteria remain.  If consumed immediately, we may consume a small (or large) amount of the contamination microorganisms.  However, if the chicken is subjected to temperature abuse, then the bacteria will likely grow to high numbers within the chicken and we will consume this highly contaminated chicken without realising it.  You might say, hey hang on, I really do think I’m going to know if a food item is going to make by sick, I’ll know if it is “off”.  We,, that’s kind of a misconception, because almost without exception, you won’t know.  Foods unsafe to eat nearly always look, smell and taste normal.  The foods that are “off”, and noticeably spoiled, are those that have been overgrown by food spoilage microorganisms, bacteria or fungi, which are generally not capable of making you sick.  They are spoilage microorganisms and not pathogenic microorganisms, and therefore cannot make you sick, they just don’t have the capacity to do so. This brings me to my last point – how long does all this take?  …from point of consumption until you realise you have “gastro”?  An absolute minimum of 24 hours, but typically, 48 to 72 hours, and in some cases longer.  This is because it takes time for the bacteria to establish in your body and then to grow to high enough numbers that your immune system cannot overcome, which results in clinical disease.  So basically, once symptoms typical of that disease present, you have lost the battle.So there you have it, the difference between intoxications and infections in the context of foodborne disease.  Next time you have what seems like a bout of food poisoning, a foodborne disease, it would be better practice to case your mind back at least or three days, possible more, to identify any risky food safety situations you can recall.  Of course though, you may have COVID-19, which under rare circumstances, can present gastrointestinal symptoms.

food spoilage,"bacteria, food-quality, food-spoilage",The future of practical food microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-future-of-practical-food-microbiology/,"January 29, 2022","How we work within food microbiology – important topics … and the techniques and conceptual approaches that make it happen.Molecular methodologies dominate practical aspects of modern biology – food, environmental and agricultural microbiology is no exception.  However, it is more important for analytical methodologies in these areas of microbiology to focus on accuracy and precision rather than speed.  In other areas of food microbiology, such as food safety investigations during disease outbreaks, where rapid results are especially important, rapid and sometimes real-time methods are vital.  However, speed is relatively unimportant when detecting and identifying microorganisms in the context of food fermentations, environmental microbiology studies and agricultural microbiology.  Thus, time to result is relatively unimportant, whereas getting as close as possible to the correct result is paramount, even if the “correct result” is an unknown bacterial species.  Sometimes, obtaining any result may not be possible at all, which is one of the challenges.Unlike other areas of microbiology, like food safety outbreak investigations, many a time, work in these areas has more of a focus on investigation and detection of non-standard or rare microorganisms.  Such investigations could very well involve novel microorganisms, completely new to science.  Therefore, by and large, a different approach is required, compared to those fields of microbiology which routinely involve investigation of typical, known and expected microorganisms.  The idea ‘you find what you look for’ is so true in these particular microbiology analyses, where, in the case of environmental samples, very few microorganisms may be culturable, despite being metabolically active.  Consequently, what doesn’t work that well in environmental microbiology investigations are comparison of results to known databases or using known PCR primers.  As a result, investigative protocols based on 16s rRNA tend to work best (Benllochet al., 1995).  There will still be some limitations if a PCR methodology is employed, but independent testing regimes exist (Rosselliet al., 2016), which therefore do away with the limitation of the use of primers to known gene sequences.Molecular and spectroscopic approaches to analytical microbiologyPrior to the era of routine molecular biology, traditional cultural and biochemical methods, relying on genetic differences manifesting as observable phenotypic differences, were the mainstay of bacterial detection and identification, in food microbiology and indeed other areas of microbiology.  However, since 1995 when the first bacterial genome was sequenced, molecular genetics, in particular of whole genomes, has moved into the area of semi-routine.  Previously limited by technical capabilities, the shortcomings of combining numerous short DNA sequences were largely overcome, at least in a practical sense in certain applications by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE).  However, this has been rapidly superseded by whole genome sequencing (WGS), used increasingly for routine foodborne disease outbreak investigations of an epidemiological nature.  This allows for unprecedented levels of precision in strain distinction and hence for determining relatedness, allowing for previously unmatched levels of understanding in the development and movement of bacterial pathogens.Workflow of whole genome sequencing in a laboratory.In addition, the interface of biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics as a combination in various areas of applied microbiology, allows for the development of practical approaches to solving real-world problems in food microbiology that have never been possible.  For example, while the use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) isn’t new in the context of food quality analysis, it is now being refined and extended into a new level of precision for pathogenic bacterial detection in food products.  This, and other approaches, such as electrochemical-based sensor technology for detection of spoilage bacteria within food products offers quick and precise analysis that isn’t invasive.  Overall, the field of molecular microbiology is more prominent than ever, with various omics techniques, in particular genomics, proteomics and metabolomics, becoming an increasing indispensable part of modern microbiology.  As in all areas of biology, going (or gone!) are the days of purely phenotypic characterisation as being sufficient.  Today demands a greater understanding, to levels never before seen, as we delve deep into cell biology and genetics, unlocking secrets with increasing capabilities due to contributions from diverse fields of chemistry, physics and mathematics, that combine, to propel analytical microbiology to a whole new era in the coming years.https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0039914016308281-fx1.jpgReal-time on-site near infrared spectroscopy analysis.Progress on approaches to grow microorganisms that cannot be grown as yet,The topic of this section can be related to either those bacterial cells that have never been cultured, and it is understood that an estimated 99% of all species of Archaea and Bacteria are yet to be cultured, or in the so-called viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state, a concept developed some 40 years ago by Xuet al.(1982) to describe the survival mechanism state where normally culturable bacterial cells that are metabolically active, enter into a state of being unable to be cultured.  This would essentially result in false negative readings in microbiologically food analysis, where the metabolically active bacterial cells are in fact present, but although unable to grow and form colonies on artificial media, may certainly still be virulent and remain in a state of pathogenicity.  Thus, Fakruddinet al.(2013) states that negative microbiological test results from food products cannot necessarily be considered from pathogens.  A key feature of the preceding section is the fact that molecular level and omics techniques are contributing to bring forth elements of discovery previously unheard of, and thus enabling their incorporation into routine commercial, industrial  and/or diagnostic practice.  This too, is a key feature here, where DNA analysis techniques are likely to offer improved opportunities for exploring the largely unexplored microbial world in the context of food microbiology.  This could very well provide some breakthrough moments in industrial and/or public health challenges and furthermore, may offer new opportunities to be developed, in potentially unknown ways, from the identification, genome sequence of and industrial/research use of potentially undiscovered microorganisms.  A practical consideration is how to survey and collect microorganisms from a whole range of extreme environments on our planet.  There were great limitations on advancements in this field prior to the widespread availability of molecular analysis tools.  Despite the benefits of a molecular-based approach, Rampelotto (2013) states that the modern techniques of molecular biology, when used in combination with traditional cultural methods, will deliver the best approach.https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/237514/fmicb-08-00580-HTML/image_m/fmicb-08-00580-g001.jpgDevelopment of the viable but nonculturable state in bacterial food borne

and how microorganisms may help.As much as humans believe they can do anything, and essentially effect total control over the world, the biosphere and our planet, we have a major global pandemic put everything into perspective for us.  This demonstrates how the unseen can exert near total control, how an entity that doesn’t even satisfy the criteria to be classified as a form of life, can wreak catastrophic havoc.  However, the microbial world must not be seen as evil, for it is the delicate balance in our biosphere, driven by microorganisms that has not only brought stability our world for billions of years, but gradually allowed a myriad of lifeforms to evolve and flourish.  Despite the resilience of the microbial-stabilised biosphere, our planet must not be taken for granted.  We have assumed the role as the current custodians of our planet and are privileged with the responsibility of ensuring it remains habitable, not just for our species, but for as many species’ as possible.  This requires an acknowledgement of the key role of microorganisms in this aspect, through their fundamental contribution to energy and nutrient cycling along with their base position in many food webs, especially those in aquatic biomes, which cover around three quarters of our planet.  The absolute fundamental contribution of microorganisms to sustainable agriculture and hence food production and food security through stabilisation of climatic deterioration and biospheric harmony not only requires acknowledgement, but action.  We can do this, we are all in this together, what we must all do our part to keep this world habitable, then to improve our planet and ultimately, to ensure the longevity of our planet in the face of mounting challenges.  The answers to do all this lie with microorganisms, from a multitude of perspectives – newly developed probiotic and/or fermented manufactured foods, regenerative agriculture, restriction of antibiotic use in livestock, to name some of the ways that microorganisms can contribute to widespread improvements in our world.Society appears to have reached the stage where traditional scientific approaches may not be able to sustain humanity into the future.  Not only does technology need to continue progressing, but so do people’s mindsets and attitudes.  These are key to furthering society as in many instances throughout history, advances have been limited by resistance from consumers, the general public, who have staunch beliefs and attachments to their traditions and what they are familiar with.  However, the general public must move past this, because these technologies of the future (and even technologies of the past, that have met with untold resistance) are needed to advance humanity, in fact, putting it simply, for society to have a chance of addressing the immense global challenges in the space of agriculture and food, policy makers will need to be able to select from any (safe) technology that is available.  Two that come to mind are food irradiation for food preservation and recombinant DNA technology for development of crops able to better provide food for the continued boom in population growth expected over the coming decades.  Both of these, are in some form, associated with microbiology.What are the big problems of the world?  Furthermore, can we predict what might be global or significant regional challenges that we haven’t encountered yet?  Perhaps not.  Look at the ongoing impact of COVID-19.  In the late 2000s, Barclay (2008) provided insights into attempts to predict future pandemics.  Not long after that, yet another influenza pandemic swept the world and then, 10 years on from that pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 emerged.  It is easy to say that humanity is at the mercy of infectious disease, but even if the science was equal to the task, there are complex social and political considerations at play, many of which stem from traditions, attachments and the generally strong mindsets and attitudes that are not easy to shift.  A way to address this, is perhaps, two-pronged.  Involvement of the general community in so-called ‘citizen science’ projects along with sustained consumer awareness campaigns carried out in parallel.There’s no doubt food in general is at the cornerstone of humanity’s issues.  Whether this be food security, improving yield, reducing spoilage and food waste, farming marginal lands or combating foodborne disease, these are all major contemporary issues.  If any of these could be successfully addressed, just one, it would be a miraculous achievement for humanity.  They do present seemingly insurmountable hurdles to society, but there are answers, science really has the potential to answer them and especially so microbiology.  How can this be?  Furthermore, is it really that easy and how can we be sure that microbiology has the answers?  Of course we cannot, but the microbial world has provided, has had many solutions to humanity, over millennia.  There have been profound solutions, solutions to problems that have changed the course of humanity – take antibiotics.  Solutions so significant that they are still practiced to this day, under the same that they were thousands of years ago, for example fermented food products.  Microbiology, and the answers it has given and revolutions it has helped develop are amongst the most significant over the entire course of human history.  Therefore, the secrets of the microbial world are just waiting to be unlocked, explored and from there, we may just discover many tools that will save humanity, solve the challenges of the world and perhaps, again, change the course of humanity.ReferenceBarclay, E., 2008.

food spoilage,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage","For accurate (niche) information in food science, go to an expert.",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/for-accurate-niche-information-in-food-science-go-to-an-expert/,"March 15, 2021","Mainstream media certainly has a place to play in dissemination of information.  However, I don’t believe the place or a role of mainstream media is to write about scientific topics of public health importance, giving advice and interpretation of various aspects that could result in a life or death choice.  Such topics must be left to the professionals.  The idea for this blog article came to mind when I was reading an article indelishdated 12 March 2021 (link below this paragraph), written by Kristin Salaky.  Just to be clear, I don’t have anything against Kristin Salaky as a person (I had never heard of her until reading this article of hers) or her writingper se.  She isn’t a food scientist, not even a scientist, so she can’t be blamed for the errors in her article.  For the record, Kristin has a bachelor degree in journalism from Ohio University and her LinkedIn profile says she has “…a background in women’s and gender studies as well as health…”, yet she is writing on food science.  The problem I have is that mainstream of generic publications for the general public have non-specialists with no real understanding or knowledge writing about topics that could result in a life or death choice – yes, it really is that serious!  Let me take you through parts of her article and explain.Yes, You Can Probably Eat Food (Slightly!) After Its Expiration Date — DelishWhile it is certainly true that food past the Use By date might be safe to eat, the Use By date is there for a reason.  The reason is to let you know the last date the food is guaranteed to be safe to eat.  Yes, true, if it has only been a day or two past the Use By, then it could very well still be ok – I eat food past it’s Use By date, but I consider various factors in making that choice, and I have the benefit of professional understanding in food safety and experience.  Therefore, for consumers, it is certainly not advisable to consume food past it’s Use By date, under any circumstances.  Kristin goes on to say that if the food has no signs of spoilage, then you can make the assumption that the food is safe to eat.  Unfortunately, she is confusing what is probably the most fundamental aspect of food safety and quality, and in the process, misleading readers, which could make a choice based on what she has written, with dire consequences.  Firstly, I must say, she has it wrong – spoilage is unrelated to safety and if a food is not spoiled, that does not mean in any way, shape or form, that you can draw a conclusion about that food’s microbial safety.  The two are independent from one another, not related at all.  This is the reason why there are Use By dates (for food safety purposes) and Best Before dates (for food quality purposes).  A food that is spoiled is almost certainly safe, albeit unpleasant, to eat.  Spoilage microorganisms cannot make you sick.  Foodborne disease comes from eating food contaminated with foodborne pathogenic microorganisms, or their toxins.  These microorganisms or their toxins are present in such low amounts (yet can still cause disease) that you have no way, absolutely no way, or knowing if they are present or not.  Think about, if people could tell if a food was safe to eat because of the way it looked or the smell of it, would people be getting a foodborne disease?  If unsafe food smelled or looked bad or off, nobody would eat it and nobody won’t get foodborne disease.  The fact is, unsafe food smells, looks and tastes normal, completely normal.Again, the above extract from the article in question shows erroneous information.  Curdled milk or slimy meat will be safe to drink/eat, but will of course be extremely unpleasant!  So, I need to reiterate, if it look good and smells good, you can’t say that the food is probably safe, not by a long shot.  Looking good or smelling good is no way related to the microbial safety of a food.It is true that food won’t necessarily be unsafe on a specific date.  For certain foods, as per the food regulations for that country, food manufacturers need to include a Use By date.  However, it is a date that is selected with a margin of error included.   Food waste is a problem, and many safe foods are discarded because they are passed their Use By date.  While discarding food that is past it’s Use By date is what needs to be done, it does certainly result in a degree of unnecessary wastage of good food.  As I’ve outlined, you cannot tell if a food is safe to consume or eat from how it looks or smells, so how can you?  Well, it is a complex process and food safety professionals would use various factors to come to a conclusion in this regard.If you want an question on Use By or Best Before dates, including if a particular food is safe or not, feel free to contact me directly for advice or an answer:You can e-mail me: philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academyOr get a (nearly) instant answer by contacting me on WhatsApp!Chat on WhatsApp",
food spoilage,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",Essentials of food safety and quality,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/essentials-of-food-safety-and-quality/,"February 26, 2021","Society’s shift away from nomadic lifestyles to plant/animal domestication and urbanisationIt is generally acknowledged that the first agricultural revolution began around 10 000 BC with the domestication of animals and plants, before which time, society practiced the ‘hunter gatherer’ lifestyle of hunting animals and gathering fruits/vegetables for short term, often daily consumption.  This involved simple food preservation techniques by individuals and  families, like drying (Figure 1) and fermenting, which extended the availability of their own stock of fresh foods.  However, with the second (British) agricultural revolution and the industrial revolution, in particular, came urbanisation and the need for longer, commercial-scale safe storage of food.  This was because the distance from production to market grew significantly, as cities grew, which were typically located some distance from rural areas of food primary production.  Furthermore, this need for increased safe storage of food on a commercial scale also enabled the manufactured food industry to develop thermal processing, such as canning, which is also a way that food can be stored for long(er) periods of time.  However, we now increasing are aware of the negative aspects of thermal processing on organoleptic and nutritional quality.  While thermal techniques remain the mainstay of food processing, newer non-thermal technologies are gaining ground, such as high pressure processing (HPP).  From hunter gatherer nomadic lifestyles to high pressure processing – looking forward to seeing what exciting developments the world of food microbiology has in store.Figure 1: Drying herbs to preserve them.Food quality and spoilageThe ultimate reason for food preservation and the need to safely store food is because it “goes off”.  We are all familiar with the concept of food “going off”, with mouldy bread and fruits or slimy meat (Figure 2) for example.  Although these are, by and large, the more commonly encountered causes of food spoilage, there are others.  For example, lumpiness (age gelation, which results from specific protein complexes forming) or sedimentation in UHT (long-life) milk (which results from enzyme action degrading the protein) or the white (or pale yellow) coloured pineapple juice (resulting from ultraviolet light stimulated degradation reactions of the colour compounds).  Food preservation is generally concerned with the maintenance of the quality of food, and consequently to prevent its spoilage and ultimate contribution to the significant (and growing) food waste problem.Figure 2: Spoiled meat.Foodborne disease and food safetyWhat is regarded as foodborne disease can be caused by a variety of microorganisms, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic.  These types of microorganisms tend to cause foodborne disease in characteristic ways from characteristic foods.  Due to the way and ease with  which foodborne viruses tend to be spread, they tend to be the most common microorganisms.  The faecal-oral route, common with foodborne viruses such as Rotavirus that causes diarrhoea, is a commonly occurring, and easily preventable, means of transmitting foodborne disease.  Pathogenic bacteria are widespread in the natural and artificial environment, grow well in many foods and thrive at temperatures typical of temperature abuse of foods.  Yeast and moulds, although more widespread than bacteria, grow slower than bacteria and tend to be outgrown by bacteria, except in high acid and low water activity foods -intrinsic product parameters which will largely inhibit bacterial growth.  Protozoan parasites and parasitic worms are even less common, as they usually have complex life cycles (Figure 3), sometimes requiring multiple hosts.  They also grow more slowly (than prokaryotes) and have quite narrow requirements for growth parameters.Figure 3: Life cycle ofToxoplasma gondiiExpiry dates: The difference between Use By and Best BeforeA vital distinction to know is the difference between Use By dates and Best Before dates (Figure 4), and how this relates to shelf-life.  To start with though, a common misconception is that unsafe food is somehow different in taste, smell and so, from safe food.  This is almost certainly never true – if that was the case, few people would contract a foodborne disease.  The fact is that the unpleasant changes you see or smell in or on food, are most often the  result of the growth of spoilage microorganisms, which are typically harmless.  Yes, it might be unpleasant to consume some of them, but they won’t make you sick.  They are not pathogenic and have no way to cause disease.  The onset of these unpleasant changes with food can signal the end of shelf-life.  In practice, it is usually subtle quality changes that happen before then, that determine a Best Before date, such as a reduction in crispness of a potato chip, or the way a sauce flows out of the bottle or the reduced carbonation of soft drinks.  The Use By date on the other hand is all about safety – after the Use By date, that food is considered unsafe to eat, and should be discarded.  This is on contrast to the Best Before date, after which, a reduction in expected product quality may be apparent, but the food or drink will still be perfectly safe to consume.Figure 4: The distinction between Use By dates and Best Before dates.",
food spoilage,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",Our first 50,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/our-first-50/,"February 3, 2021","We’ve hit the half century!  Between 22 December 2019 and today, 3 February 2021, we’ve published 50 blog articles.  What a journey and what a great time we’ve had growing, learning and lending our expertise to solve real-world issues for our clients in different parts of the world.The Food Microbiology Academy journey started during the Black Friday sales of November 2019, with the upgrade of our WordPress website, then we registered our domain name shortly thereafter, and pushed out our first blog article on our website three days before Christmas.  We started with an intention of engaging in primarily research activities, with teaching to support it.  However, it was evident in January 2020 that our expertise in the food preservation space was valued, and we finished a couple of small consulting projects early in February 2020 for clients in London and New York.  Wow yes, our first two clients were located in the two most significant global cities!  During the course of the year we continued to build on our early success in consulting, and took on a Taipei-located lead food safety auditor to our team.  With her industry experience in QC and understanding of bakery manufacture, coupled with her sharp and exacting knowledge of food safety, we greatly expanded our capacity.After working with clients in Bali, Calgary (Alberta, Canada) and the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex in the United States, among others, we are now in a position to expand our service offerings and capabilities beyond consulting to the food manufacturing industry.  To this end, we have finalised appointment of someone located in Sydney that will lead our education and training programs, initially online courses in microbiology, but ultimately training programs for the food manufacturing industry.What have we learnt?  As much as I (Philip) was thinking that food safety was what I wanted to be actively involved in, that really doesn’t seem the understanding and expertise the industry needs.  I’m a bacteriologist, and tended to be more interested in food safety.  However, I found that my interests and expertise wasn’t that relevant and it was more mycology along with food quality and spoilage expertise that is actually more useful when consulting to the food manufacturing industry.  Many people wish to optimise or extend the shelf-life of their manufactured food products, and it typically isn’t bacteria that are limiting the shelf-life, more often it is mould growth.  So I found myself getting excited about yeasts and moulds and spoiled food, then working with either I) established small to medium food manufacturers to troubleshoot mould-based spoilage issues and/or extend the shelf-life of those products, particular so that new export markets could be reached or II) food entrepreneurs who need shelf-life and food preservation advice to simply know how long their product will remain stable for.  Yes, it was different to bacterial food borne disease, but this different area I slotted into was a refreshing change, and one which I found satisfying, to an extent I didn’t expect.The next exciting period of our growth is consolidating ourselves in the consulting world, while we establish our offerings in research and in education and training.  To this end, as mentioned above, we have made an appointment of someone to lead our education and training area, and are actively looking to fill our newly created leadership positions in research and in consulting and extension.  With these three functional areas capably led, we’ll be able to advance in accordance with our mission toward our vision.  This is indeed a particularly exciting development early in our second year of operation.What kind of advice or insights may I be able to offer or do I have in food microbiology or in establishing an organisation like this?  Here are some that come to mind:There is plenty of opportunity in food quality and spoilage, as the economic impacts are significant.Resist the temptation to have a business plan at the start of your organisation.  Instead, have a framework and a mindset that allows self-reflection and reflection of the organisation so that change to occur as you work flexibly and fluidly towards attaining a minimum viable product or service.It doesn’t hurt to focus on the basis!  Start small (one person!) and concentrate on your expertise/interests.Another temptation to resist is distraction – many of us with an entrepreneurial mind have too many ideas.  Learn which you should pursue and when you should give them up.Know your WHY.  ‘Why’ you are doing what you’re doing is so important, as a business coach told me a few weeks ago.  My ‘why’ is to improve the quality of life of people – through safer food, fresher food and healthier food.  This is why I love my work, because of the difference I make to the quality of life of people in this way through food.Keep trying things, have outlandish ideas and just give them a go.  People are generally not going to make great strides by playing it safe and adopting a risk-free approach.Most of all, you’ve got to love what you’re doing otherwise you won’t want to do it!",

A few weeks ago, I started moving our video content to our new Brand YouTube channel, with the first (and so far the only!) video on our channel being  on my career in food microbiology.  In fact, this video formed the basis of our vlog posted on May 24, which is located here:http://foodmicrobiology.academy/2020/05/24/my-food-microbiology-career/.So anyway, a few days ago my video was found by a (very) young aspiring food microbiologist in Mumbai, India.  This teenage student made some comments to initiate a conversation with my around career advice and guidance, then we continue our discussions through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.  Now, we’re about to formalise our discussions with a mentoring agreement.  This is just great news and of mutual benefit as she can clearly gain from my years on a non-traditional career path and I real feel like I’m ‘giving back’ and encouraging and ‘grooming’ the next generation of passionate food microbiologists to come along and really take on the challenges of the world and solve them, which we can all really achieve together.  This student is pretty amazing because even at her young age, she has a career vision and a firm goal of wanting to work in the area of food safety and foodborne diseases at the World Health Organization.  With such a plan at such an early age, she can so get there as well.  What I wanted this blog post to be was to introduce the career mentoring thatFood Microbiology Academynow offers by elaborating on some of the examples I provided to this mentee during our early discussions.Firstly, too many people, myself included years ago in the mid to late 1990s, have a general career idea but no firm goal and vision.  Without this, you do almost wander aimlessly to some extent.  Thus, I would say – don’t worry about or try and identify what you will study as your undergraduate degree and where until you have identified your dream job.  Then, you can work backwards.  Setting your dream job as your goal will help answer so many questions, such as:Which is the highest degree I’ll need?Do I need to do a Master degree?  if so, should it be a research or coursework Master degree?Which country should I complete my various degrees in?What should my undergraduate degree be in?What sort of opportunities should I seek during holidays or internships to support me reaching my career goal(s)?For example, if you have come to the conclusion that you need a PhD, does the Australian (three years, one laboratory, research only) or North American (four years, laboratory rotations during the first year, 25% coursework) model work better for you and your career.  Then, for training like a PhD, the importance of factors that you should consider can be ranked like this, from most important to least important: Supervisor > Laboratory > Department > University > Country.  Some people get to hung up over doing their PhD in a particular country or a particular university.  However, it is the supervisor that is most critical and I’m sure you can find exceptional academic supervisors leading world-class research groups engaging in cutting edge discoveries located in what many would consider sub-standard universities or lower ranking countries for research training or higher education in general.However, you may not even be at the stage where you can identify your ideal or dream job, but you just have a hankering for food microbiology.  In such case, perhaps consider the following, as a non-exhaustive list of careers in food microbiology that require high levels of responsibility, so senior positions that typical require a PhD:I)Teaching food microbiology in a college/university(professor in a community college).II)Doing food safety research in a university(research-only academic position, like Research Assistant Professor or Senior Research Fellow, in a research-intensive university).III)Teaching food microbiology and doing food safety research in a university(traditional academic position).IV)Doing food safety research and development in a food manufacturing company(only food manufacturing companies of substantial size, like Nestlé would engage in such R&D)V)Consulting and therefore providing advice to small and medium size food companies on keeping their products safe(either as an independent consultant or working for a scientific consulting firm).VI)Managing food safety at a large food manufacturing company(this may be part of a quality management role of if the food manufacturing operation is large enough, then it would be a seperate position).VII)Tracking foodborne diseases and identifying sources of outbreaks(such as at a government health organisation, which could be at a national level like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States or the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory in the Australian state of Victoria)VIII)Developing public health strategies and government policy to reduce foodborne disease(an advisory role in government to assemble scientific information and make recommendations for policy and legislative changes to protect the health of the citizens under the jurisdiction of the government you’re working for).So, if you’re a budding food microbiologist (no pun intended!) or simply want to find out more about careers and working in our field, do contact myself (Dr Philip Button, @pdbutton, by e-mail to philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academy).","career, career choice, food microbiologist, mentoring"
food spoilage,"food-safety, food-spoilage",Teaching food microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/teaching-food-microbiology/,"July 26, 2020","^ Memories of teaching food microbiology at The University of Melbourne – with some of my undergraduate students near the end of second semester in 2008.We are (re)launching our academic support services (Figure 1), which include tutoring and guidance for research students.  It therefore seemed appropriate at this stage that I share my teaching philosophy, so basically how I approach teaching of food microbiology.  Without any further ado, here is my teaching philosophy.Figure 1: Food Microbiology Academy’s tutoring and academic support.Teaching is a passion for me. I thoroughly enjoy contributing to students’ acquisition of knowledge and feel truly satisfied when they have really understand a topic or even a concept.My main area of teaching focus is microbiology, particularly in food and industrial microbiology.  However, I am able and very much willing to teach a diversity of courses in different areas of microbiology, immunology, pathology or biochemistry, for example.It is imperative to ensure that material presented is relevant to what is currently practiced in industry or in a research setting. Therefore, the course content I deliver is always up to date with present trends, methodologies and thinking. For example, in 2011, I overhauled the advanced undergraduate level Food and Industrial Microbiology course I was co-ordinating at Monash University, to ensure the lectures included coverage of rapid, molecular identification techniques (among other alternative approaches to microbial identification) in addition to the diversity of non-thermal processing methods, some of which were in commercial use already.I am a strong believer of problem based learning teaching methods, but acknowledge that this approach isn’t suited to all topics and subject areas. In those cases, I would use the traditional lecture format to deliver the basic concepts and then use problem based learning to reinforce the fundamental knowledge. I feel this is particularly suited to food microbiology (but not general microbiology) and food processing/manufacturing technology. Related to this approach, I also like to try and teach from original research papers on a particular topic, especially when considering foodborne disease outbreaks or incidents of food spoilage. Using this approach previously, I have allocated a particular research paper to a small group of students and asked them to read it and present relevant details (according to a specified set of questions) to the class – a short discussion session follows presentation of each paper.  To enable students to consolidate their newly acquired theoretical knowledge, I believe that the theoretical material for a practical class must be presented in the week of the practical class. To ensure this, I would carefully structure a course so that students gain benefit from this. Furthermore in practical classes, unless all students are given the opportunity for “hands on” experiences, holding practical classes is pointless. This is because, to me, practical classes are the times when all students must have the opportunity to get close to the real science and the real technology and actually do it.  Therefore, I would carefully consider the type of exercise, class scheduling and class numbers to guarantee the effective learning experience of all students.I believe that group work has a place in tertiary education today, but consider that it is an area that isn’t a high priority. In my opinion, students must be able to work on their own first and recognise their own strengths and weaknesses and be competent independent workers, so that they can contribute fairly to group work. Therefore, it would be important to incorporate group work for a “taste” of what is to come in the workplace, but to ensure a system such that group work is not assessed solely on the product, but that some weighting is given to the process as well.There is no point in teaching without determining how effective the teaching is. Formal course evaluations of teaching quality provide an indication as to the general areas where improvement is best directed. However, I enjoy casual interactions with students after class and during practical sessions as this is when I can really gauge their understanding of the material and provide direct and personalised information to a particular student to fill a deficiency in their knowledge. I also value the use of practice exams, to gain an honest assessment of where the students are with the material, both individually and as a class.","food microbiology, teaching, teaching philosophy, university"
food spoilage,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",How to preserve food with ozone,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/how-to-preserve-food-with-ozone/,"July 22, 2020","Heat treatment of food was a marvellous public health revolution.  It enabled safe food to last longer and was an advancement from the early preservation methods of salting, smoking and the like.  Despite the many advantages of thermal treatment of food, there are of course detrimental effects.  For many decades, the advantages of heat preserving food outweighed the disadvantages.  However, in the past 20-30 years, many non-thermal food processing technologies have emerged as commercially viable.  This is despite many of these actually old technologies.  One such technology is ozonation.  Many technological advancements have enabled a wide range of different approaches to food preservation to come to the fore, another important reason is consumer-driven.  That reason is indeed a driver of food trends and the fact that consumers increasingly want minimally processed foods that represent a ‘clean and green’ approach of sourcing and processing.Ozone is another food processing technology that tends to be referred to as ’emerging’ or ‘innovative’ when in fact it is old technology.  It is reported to have been first used for water treatment in 1893, in the Netherlands, and for food (meat) preservation in 1909, in Germany.  Just to be clear at this stage that ozone is a gas, O3, which has one additional oxygen atom compared to molecules of oxygen, O2.What can ozone be used for?It has wide applications in the food industry (Figure 1), and not only in food preservation:Ensuring microbiological safety of foods.Prevention of spoilage and extending shelf-life.Disinfection of water supplies.Sanitisation of surfaces in food manufacturing facilities (Figure 2).Eliminating odours in food.Reducing the residual pesticides remaining on fresh produce.Figure 1: Applications of ozone in the food sector.Figure 2: How ozonated water can be used in food processing plants.What foods can ozone be used with/on?It’s more what foods that ozone is NOT compatible with!  Ozone is very versatile indeed and can be used with these foods or types of products:Fresh or frozen foods.Fruits and vegetables.Red meat, poultry and seafood.Dairy foods.Spices.Beverages.Nuts.How is ozone formed?For ozone to form, air or ideally pure oxygen (for a higher yield when actually generating ozone) is necessary as the starting point (Figure 3) (Step 1).  Energy is then required to split the oxygen molecule into individual atoms.  This energy more often comes in the form of a corona discharge (Step 2).  Once oxygen atoms are available, they are free to bond with any oxygen molecules that have not split, which forms ozone (Step 3).  During its action, one of the oxygen atoms from the ozone molecule splits off  (Step 4) and you have an oxygen molecule remaining (Step 5).  This is another big advantage of this technology, no toxic/harmful end products, just simple and human-life-sustaining oxygen molecules.Figure 3: Formation of ozone.How is ozone generated?The above paragraph outlines about how ozone is actually formed, but how about its actual commercial generation?  As mentioned previously generation using energy from corona discharge is more common, as can be seen in Figure 4.  At the start of the process we have oxygen molecules entering the system, either as air or pure oxygen.  A fan blows the gas to the part of the unit where the high voltage corona discharge provides energy for disruption of the oxygen molecules to make individual oxygen atoms available.  These oxygen atoms combine with oxygen molecules to form ozone.Figure 4: Corona discharge ozone generation.How can ozone be applied to food, water or surfaces?In either aqueous or gaseous forms.  Where possible, the gaseous form would be preferred due to increased stability of the ozone compared to the aqueous form.  These diagrams show the process of treating food with ozone.  In each case, note that an ozone generator close by the treatment area is mandatory, due to the stability of ozone, even in the gaseous phase.  In Figure 5 we have an example of how ozone can be applied to food when the ozone is diffused in water.  To start the process the oxygen is concentrated before entering the generation unit.  Next is the treatment chamber, where the generated ozone is physically combined with water, by one or two techniques, either venturi injection or fine bubble diffusion.  Due to instability, immediate use of the ozonated water is a must.Figure 5: How ozone is generated and applied in aqueous form.With the application of gaseous ozone to food, Figure 6 shows this process, where you have air or pure oxygen flowing into ozone generation unit, which then enters the treatment chamber for the gaseous treatment of the food.  Now, although ozone degrades to oxygen gas after use, it is very important to be aware that ozone is a harmful gas, as a respiratory irritant at low concentrations or at high concentrations it can be fatal.  Thus, monitoring of the amount of residual ozone remaining after treatment is necessary, then the passage of this output gas through an ozone destructor is required to ensure that no ozone remains and is emitted into the processing environment.Figure 6: How ozone is generated and applied in gaseous form.This is an overview of the technology, what it can be used for and how to use it.",

Throughout history we have seen this and even most recently, or should I say currently, the overwhelming wants of many in society have seen protests and rallies the world over for Black Lives Matter, despite the very real dangers from the surging COVID-19 pandemic.  In just a matter of weeks, this has become a real global movement with rapid change occurring that one would not have thought possible a couple of months ago.  Thus, it is people and society that are drivers of change.  If a voice is loud enough, and/or persistent enough, it will be heard.  I didn’t intend this blog post to be an information piece on sociology, but wanted to highlight how powerful voices can be as drivers of reform, policy change and indeed even ideological foundations.  Therefore, we can see that people are able to lead change and drive change in so many areas.Food is a big one in this regard.  Food is a major part of culture and identity, plus it is an integral part of daily life.  As a result of these reasons, many people tend to have quite strong views or opinions with regard to food.  It is these views or opinions, if held by enough people, can become food trends, drivers of change to the food supply.  So many people are under the misconception that food manufacturers are using processing technologies or ingredients purely for their own benefit and without regard for consumers.  This is not true, and here’s why.  Food manufacturers are dependent on sales of their products for survival of their business.  If they do not take into consideration what consumers want or don’t want, they are then directly harming their business.  Think about it – consumers have a preference, for example, against artificial chemical preservatives in food, but if a food manufacturer loads a food with ten such preservatives to give that food a super/ultra long shelf-life to enable wide distribution to reach distant markets, what will actually happen?  Consumers will avoid that product, sales will drop and that food manufacturer will financially suffer.  It’s pretty clear-cut.  Therefore, it is in the food manufacturer’s best interests to give consumers what they want – such as minimal processing or preservative-free foods, for example.  To be clear about this – it is consumers which drive food trends, with food manufacturers merely responding to these food trends that consumers are creating with their preferences.Ok, so what is actually trending in my expertise area of food preservation?  Consumers are after natural, ‘clean and green’ (Figure 1) and desire quality food.  Food quality is more than non-spoiled food these days.Figure 1: Ways to eat ‘clean’.Quality of food tends to also refer to high in (original) taste along with minimal nutritional deterioration.  These reflect the ‘natural’ aspect of food.  Marry consumers’ interests with the long shelf-life desired by food manufacturers, and you have what might seem an impossible situation … combining a long shelf-life without the traditional approach to food preservation using chemical preservatives.  So how can we do this?  Well, it’s my intention here to just raise the names of the plethora of alternative processing technologies either in use or under various stages of development – such as:High pressure processingPulsed electric fieldIonising radiationOhmic heatingRadio frequencyMicrowavesUltrasoundUltraviolet lightInfrared heatingOzone (Figure 2)Supercritical carbon dioxidePower ultrasoundsCold plasma (Figure 3)Electrolysed waterHigh voltage arc dischargePulsed lightFigure 2: An industrial scale ozone-based fruit disinfection system.Figure 3: Benefits of cold plasma for eliminating fungi and mycotoxins from food.In many, or should I say most, foods to be processed, heat is still the best option.  It could be due to effectiveness in ensuring a safe product or a prolonged shelf-life, financial considerations or consumer perception of the new technology.  One aspect is certain though, there is a desire to move away from thermal processing.  While it has many benefits with regard to its effective elimination or reduction of microorganisms, there are a whole range of detrimental effects of heat on product quality, which consumers are increasing not willing to tolerate.  The tough aspect can be to find an alternative that is I) financially viable for the manufacturer, II) addresses safety requirements set by government authorities, III) enable an appropriately long shelf-life, IV) improves or at least maintains quality (sensory and nutritional) quality of the product and V) is accepted by consumers.  Unfortunately, sometimes the (very) loud voices of a (very) small minority of radical opponents to a new technology drown out the scientists attempting to speak the truth about a new technology.  This can lead to very delayed introduction sometimes of an effective and safe technology.  Such a scenario should not be allowed to stay in the way of the progress of humanity, which unfortunately it has many a time.  Just look at ionising radiation in food preservation, also known as food irradiation or GM foods.  Both are demonstrated to be extremely safe, yet there is strong public opposition (Figure 4) despite benefits for food preservation and wastage (Figure 5) and for the environment (Figure 6).  Opposition based on what? …when the science says it is safe, yet these radical minorities cling to a myth of hope that might come true one day, and devalue the work of the world’s great scientists in essentially endorsing the safety of these technologies.  Come on everyone, keep a level head and please listen to the scientists, for all our sakes!Figure 4: Public perception of the agricultural and food manufacturing industry.Figure 5: Preventing apple spoilage with GM.Figure 6: How GM crops benefits the environment.","food preservation, food science, frankenfood, gm foods, gmo"
food spoilage,"food-quality, food-safety, food-spoilage",Safety of sodium benzoate (E211),https://foodmicrobiology.academy/safety-of-sodium-benzoate-e211/,"June 15, 2020","Originally written byJill Kohin 2010.  Reviewed, revised and updated byPhilip Buttonin 2020.Sodium benzoate has sparked public health concern due to the discovery of the carcinogenic chemical benzene (Figure 1) in soft drinks (Food and Drug Administration, 2007; Food Standards Agency, 2006). Benzene is a known carcinogen “by all routes of exposure” (Ibolyaet al., 2012) and is present in the atmosphere from exhaust emissions (220 μg) and cigarette smoke (7900 μg) (Figure 2). Benzene levels have only been regulated in drinking water with an upper limit of 5 ppb in the USA (Food and Drug Administration, 2007), or 10 μg/kg in UK (Food Standards Agency, 2006). An early study in 1993 reported that formation of benzene in soft drinks is attributed to the decarboxylation of benzoic acid in the presence of ascorbic acid and transition metals naturally occurring in water (Gardner & Lawrence, 1993). In addition, elevated temperatures and light can stimulate benzene formation under the conditions above which render soft drinks to be a significant source of benzene (Food and Drug Administration, 2007).Figure 1: Benzene is carcinogenic.Figure 2: There are various sources of benzene exposure in everyday activities.The FDA has since initiated a survey on benzene levels in soft drinks and other beverages and found 9 out of 200 beverage products with benzene levels above 5 ppb. The respective manufacturers voluntarily reformulated the products and recent testing reported benzene levels in these products were less than 1.5 ppb. On the other hand, the FDA also conducted tests on 150 drinks with 4 products containing benzene levels above the allowed 10 μg/kg limit.  As such, all 4 products were recalled from the market. In its latest update the FDA has assured the public that it is working closely with the beverage industry to ensure benzene levels are minimized or eliminated where possible.  One way this could be achieved, while prolonging shelf-life at the same time, is through use of the natural additives nisin and natamycin (Garavagliaet al., 2019) which reduced microbial counts and reduced the formation of benzene.  The FDA has also reassured the public that sodium benzoate is still a safe preservative at a daily intake of <0.5g. This is because the body excretes benzoic acid in the urine as hippuric acid (Figure 3), leaving no accumulation of benzoic acid in the body (Belitz, Grosch, & Schieberle, 2009).Figure 3: Conversion of benzoic acid into hippuric acid.Another health concern related to sodium benzoate is the potential effect of causing hyperactivity in children. McCann et al. (2007) conducted an experiment to study the effects of artificial food colour and additives on childhood behaviour and concluded that consumption of foods with sodium benzoate or in combination with artificial colours resulted in increased hyperactivity in 3 year old and 8/9 year old children. However, the results were criticized by other professionals as inconclusive because there were observation of high sensitivity of the food additives in some hyperactive children, while others were unresponsive to the additives (Eigenmann & Haenggeli, 2007). In addition, another study reported that exposure to food additives such as sodium benzoate in children and teenagers rarely reach levels that link food additives and hyperactivity (Connolly, et al., 2010). Hence, further research is needed to establish the link between food additives and hyperactivity in adolescents due to conflicting results shown above.Based on the evidences outlined above, further investigation needs to be carried out to ascertain the side effects of sodium benzoate on human health as results from studies remain inconclusive. However, the food industry is aware of growing consumer concerns on the usage of chemical processing aids in food products and is seeking potential alternatives. One such effort is the development of mathematical models describing growth/no growth boundaries of a highly resistant food spoilage yeast-Z. bailiito aid formulation of shelf-stable foods without inclusion of chemical preservatives (Dang, et al., 2010).The benefits of sodium benzoate as a preservative cannot be denied and have been successfully used in various food applications. Sodium benzoate, on its own, has not been found to have any adverse effect on human health when consumed at maximum level of 4 g/day. Therefore, until concrete results on negative effects on human health have been established, concerned consumers may avoid intake of sodium benzoate by eliminating foods containing the chemical from their diet.  However, considering the facts about sodium benzoate (Figure 4) and the very low chance of exposure benzene from food compared with other sources, elimination of sodium benzoate from the diet is not recommended.Figure 4: Summary of facts about sodium benzoate.ReferencesBelitz, H.

Therefore, there’s no doubt that microbiologists are particularly valuable at the moment.  Especially virologists and those microbiologists that have an understanding of infectious diseases, public health and/or epidemiology.  Plus, some knowledge of immunology can be helpful to for vaccine development as can pharmacology for drug development.  However, it’s really the microbiologists that are coming to the fore.  People talk about ‘saving the world’ and about the impact and importance of careers, but microbiologists really can save the world.  If you had any doubt about the importance of a career in microbiology, then just consider what is happening in the world now and what has happened since December.  …and we’re not just talking about personal and public health, but livelihoods and the global economy.  The economy has gone ‘pear-shaped’ because of a microbiological phenomenon, something that could be stopped by microbiologists, if they are, or were given the opportunity.  The power is in the hands of microbiologists and those with an intricate understanding of microbiology, to save the world, I have no doubt about that.  So, if you want a powerful career, an impactful career, a highly significant career, then consider microbiology!A FOOD MICROBIOLOGY CAREERHow about a career in food microbiology?  What might that look like and what might one be involved with?  Well even in food microbiology there are many varied areas to work in.  The three key areas are: i) food safety, ii) food spoilage/food quality and iii) fermented foods, probiotics and gut health.  Each of these has highly significant impacts on society and on the economy.  Let’s look at each of these in more detail.What is food safety?Food safety is all about ensuring the safety of the food supply.  This means monitoring, auditing, regulating and developing policy for the purposes of safeguarding raw materials and manufactured food over the entire agrifood supply chain from ‘farm to fork’ or ‘paddock to plate’ as the concept goes.  Food safety microbiologists closely associate with epidemiologists, public health professionals and infectious disease experts to combat prevention, tracking and limiting the spread of foodborne diseases of epidemic proportions.What is food spoilage and food quality?Spoilage and subsequent wastage of food results in substantial economic losses.  In countries with developing economies, such spoilage and waste of food is more likely to be fresh produce and thus postharvest and pre-manufacure losses.  In countries with advanced economies, the situation is quite different, with substantial spoilage and waste taking place at the consumer level.  Tight supply chains along with excellent mechanisms of food preservation mean that spoilage losses in such countries are at a minimum.What are fermented foods, probiotics and gut health?This area is closely linked with personal health and wellness.  There is a sustained food trend in the area of probiotics as functional foods, along with prebiotics and people realise the great benefits of how one’s gut health contributes to overall health and wellbeing.  Related to this are fermented foods, many of which are probiotic, and as such, are rich natural sources of ‘good’ bacteria.CAREER PROFILE OF A FOOD MICROBIOLOGISTWondering how a career in food microbiology might actually look like in reality?  Well, I had a Q & A session with Lucy Lam, a food safety auditor from Taipei, Taiwan.  Let’s find out what Lucy’s food microbiology career looks like…What qualification(s) do you hold and from where?Master of Science, with a major in food, nutrition and technology, from The Chinese University of Hong KongBachelor of Food Science, from The University of MelbourneYour present position and where?Auditor, Bureau Veritas Certification  (Taiwan)How would you describe your career ‘in a nutshell’?A passion for food safety and quality control along with being good at problem solving. 1. Interest in manufacturing in any field, especially the food industry 2. Looking forward to opportunities to be involved more in food product development.Describe what you do you do on a day-to-day basis?As an auditor, I follow back office schedules to visit clients and conduct on-site audit. Before and after the audit, preparation of the report document is needed.How do you gain most satisfaction in your food microbiology career?When I gained the most hands-on experience in food microbiology when I was working in the food industry between 2013 – 2018. As I was a laboratory supervisor and department assistant manager, I had to oversee the operation of the laboratory including lab supplies, SOPs, good laboratory practices and third party laboratory compliances.What can you forsee as big challenges in your particular area of food microbiology?Food microbiology testing can be regarded as a quality control gate for product release and assurance in food industry. Hence the testing lead time will be demanding and tends to be “quick and accurate”. It is believed that rapid test kits or rapid test methods will be upcoming trends in food microbiology testing.Some advice about a career in food microbiology?It is suggested people who wish to be a food microbiologist must have basic food knowledge, and willing to do a lot of research and study.So there you have it, whether it’s building the health of individuals through improving gut health, ensuring public health is maintained through a safe food supply or curbing the substantial economic losses through food spoilage and food waste, there are multiple ways to save the world as a food microbiologist!

Fungi,"bacteria, food-quality, fungi, yeast",From HPP Innovation Week – Part 2,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/from-hpp-innovation-week-part-2/,"July 5, 2024","This is the second of a two-part series of overview blog articles written byChloe Lam(chloe.lam@foodmicrobiology.academy), who attended the HPP Innovation Week session from 18-20 June 2024.Food safety controlRegarding risk analysis for ensuring food safety in food production, HPP has a role in controlling biological hazards (i.e. pathogens). By modifying HPP parameters including pressure, holding time, and water temperature, HPP can be integrated into HACCP plans as the critical control point. According to @Mario González, Ph.d. | HPP Applications Manager at Hiperbaric, HPP even has the potential to reduce the allergenicity of certain foods and reduce the concentration of mycotoxin.HPP can be used to facilitate hazard control in food products. It can be used in controlling the pathogenic microbial concentration. In terms of bacterial inactivation, HPP helps meeting the performance criterion of > 3log reduction of bacteria level established by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference. The limitation of spoilage microorganisms can minimize the formation of TMA, which lowers the risk of food poisoning. Besides, the HPP technique can facilitate the elimination of parasites. Mild HPP conditions for around 180 seconds can completely inactivate parasites from raw fish fillets. The use of mild HPP conditions not only can eliminate parasites, but also minimize the impact on quality.HPP is a versatile nonthermal food preservation technique that inactive pathogens while maintaining sensory and nutritional qualities. The implementation of HPP allows for avoiding product recalls and market withdrawals associated with biological hazards.Application in various productsMultiple researches have been conducted on various food products, including craft beer, cold brew coffee, durian, and seafood. All showed an extended reduction of spoilage bacteria levels after HPP. Unlike thermal pasteurization, HPP maintains the stability of products and does not change the quality profile of food.Taking craft beer as an illustrative example, HPP has a growing market in this field, driven by the increasing popularity and demand.  This technology can extend the shelf-life of products without the need for heating or the addition of preservatives. Even though pasteurization can effectively prevent microbial growth, it would also induce unfavorable alterations such as accelerated aging and developing a stale flavor. Notably, a significant reduction of spoilage bacteria (3.1log) is maintained throughout the product’s shelf-life (@Rui Queirós, Ph.d. | HPP Applications Specialist at Hiperbaric).On the flip side, HPP also proves highly advantageous in preserving the quality of craft beer. It can retain the quality of craft beer without altering sensory attributes, color, and alcohol content. Customers are unable to distinguish HPP-treated beer from untreated samples in sensory tests, indicating the process preserves the intended flavor profile. This highlights HPP’s suitability for maintaining the authentic taste and sensory characteristics of products, avoiding the quality degradation that can occur with heat-based treatments.Overall, the versatility of HPP technology is illustrated where it can extend shelf-life and preserve the inherent sensory qualities that consumers demand, without compromising the integrity of the final product.SummaryHigh Pressure Processing (HPP) is an innovative nonthermal food preservation technology that is transforming the food industry. By using high hydrostatic pressure, HPP can inactivate harmful microorganisms and extend the shelf-life of a wide range of food products, from meat and seafood to beverages and dips, while preserving their natural flavors, nutrients, and appearance. Compared to traditional thermal pasteurisation, HPP offers significant advantages, including the ability to create “clean label” foods with minimal additives, improve visual appeal, and facilitate more efficient and higher-yielding extraction of shellfish meat. With a rapidly growing global market, HPP is well-positioned to address consumer demand for minimally processed, safe, and high-quality foods.","food industry, food manufacturing, food microbiology, food preservation, food processing, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease"
Fungi,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, fungi, yeast",Good health from fermented dairy products,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/good-health-from-fermented-dairy-products/,"July 1, 2023","This month we’ve featured fermented goods in a big way – this is the third and final post to showcase the diversity of fermented foods across the world.  This article is about dairy products, where we feature a couple of examples in detail.  To start with, here are some unusual and different fermented dairy products from around the world:Skyr: A traditional Icelandic dairy product that resembles yogurt but has a thicker, creamier consistency. It is made from skim milk and is high in protein.Filmjölk: A fermented milk product from Sweden, similar to yogurt but with a thinner consistency. It has a slightly sour taste and is often enjoyed with fruits or muesli.Kefir: A fermented milk drink that originated in the Caucasus region. It is made by fermenting milk with kefir grains, which are a combination of bacteria and yeast. Kefir has a tangy taste and a slightly effervescent texture.Kumis: A traditional fermented dairy product from Central Asia, particularly popular in Mongolia. It is made from fermented mare’s milk and has a slightly sour and fizzy taste.Tarhana: A dried fermented dairy product found in various forms across the Middle East, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe. It is made from a mixture of fermented milk, wheat flour, and vegetables, and is often used to make soups.Dadih: A traditional Indonesian fermented buffalo milk product. It is made by coagulating the milk with a local wild grass called “elephantopus,” resulting in a custard-like texture and a tangy flavor.Clabber: A traditional Southern United States dairy product made by allowing raw milk to naturally ferment and sour. It has a thick consistency and is often used as a base for cooking or eaten with sweeteners.Suutei Tsai: A Mongolian traditional tea made with fermented milk. It is prepared by boiling green tea with milk and allowing it to ferment, resulting in a unique and tangy beverage.Amasi: A fermented milk product from Southern Africa, also known as maas. It is similar to yogurt but has a thicker consistency and a slightly sour taste.Chal: A fermented dairy product from Iran, particularly in the Gilan and Mazandaran provinces. It is made by fermenting raw cow’s milk and has a thick texture and tangy flavor.Photo by Pixabay onPexels.comSuutei Tsai,also known as Suutei Tsai, is a traditional Mongolian tea made with milk and served as a popular beverage in Mongolia. It is prepared by boiling green tea with milk, resulting in a unique and distinct flavor.The name “Suutei Tsai” translates to “milk tea” in Mongolian, reflecting its main ingredients and preparation method. The tea is typically made using a specific type of green tea leaves called “brick tea,” which are pressed into compact blocks and stored for aging before use.To make Suutei Tsai, the brick tea leaves are first broken into smaller pieces and then boiled in water. The tea is simmered for an extended period to extract the flavors from the leaves fully. During this process, the tea develops a robust and slightly bitter taste.After the tea is brewed, milk is added to create a creamy and rich texture. The amount of milk used can vary based on personal preference and regional variations. Some recipes call for equal parts tea and milk, while others use a higher ratio of milk to tea.Suutei Tsai is often sweetened with salt or sometimes with sugar or butter, depending on personal preference. The addition of salt is a unique characteristic of Mongolian milk tea, giving it a slightly savory taste that distinguishes it from other milk teas found in different cultures.This tea holds significant cultural importance in Mongolia and is commonly consumed throughout the day, particularly during meals or social gatherings. It serves as a warming and comforting beverage in the cold climate of Mongolia and is believed to have various health benefits, including aiding digestion and providing energy.Suutei Tsai represents the fusion of Mongolian nomadic traditions and the influence of neighboring cultures. It has become an integral part of Mongolian cuisine and cultural identity, offering a distinct and delightful tea-drinking experience.Clabber is a traditional dairy product that has been consumed for centuries, particularly in rural and farming communities. It is a type of milk that has naturally soured and thickened due to the activity of lactic acid bacteria. Clabber is often associated with Southern United States cuisine, where it has been a staple for generations.The process of making clabber is relatively simple. Fresh raw milk is left at room temperature for an extended period, typically overnight or up to 24 hours. During this time, naturally occurring bacteria in the milk convert lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid through the process of fermentation. This fermentation results in the milk thickening and developing a tangy, slightly sour taste.The texture and consistency of clabber can vary, depending on factors such as the temperature and the specific bacteria present. It can range from a slightly thickened milk to a custard-like consistency. The flavor is typically tart and tangy, similar to yogurt or buttermilk.Clabber can be consumed as is or used as an ingredient in various dishes. It is often enjoyed as a stand-alone food or served with sweeteners such as honey or sugar. It can also be used as a base for cooking, where it adds a tangy flavor to recipes like pancakes, biscuits, or cornbread.It’s worth noting that the production of clabber involves raw milk, which may contain harmful bacteria. Therefore, it’s important to ensure the milk comes from a safe and trusted source. In modern times, pasteurized milk is often used to make clabber as a safer alternative.Clabber represents a traditional and simple form of dairy fermentation, preserving milk while providing a tangy and distinctive flavor. It showcases the natural transformative power of bacteria and demonstrates how simple culinary techniques can create unique and culturally significant foods.Photo by Matthias Zomer onPexels.com","fermentation, food microbiology, food science, healthy eating, microbiology, probiotics"
Fungi,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, food-quality, fungi, viruses, yeast",50 facts about food microbiology!,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/50-facts-about-food-microbiology/,"June 26, 2023","Food microbiology is the study of microorganisms that interact with food, including bacteria, viruses, yeasts, molds, and parasites.Microorganisms can be both beneficial and harmful to food. Beneficial microorganisms are used in processes like fermentation and production of certain foods, while harmful microorganisms can cause foodborne illnesses.Bacteria are the most common microorganisms associated with food spoilage and foodborne diseases.Some common bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses includeSalmonella,Escherichiacoli(E. coli),Listeriamonocytogenes, andCampylobacter.Viruses, such as Norovirus and Hepatitis A, can also contaminate food and cause foodborne illnesses.Yeasts and molds are responsible for food spoilage and can affect the texture, flavor, and appearance of food.Microorganisms can contaminate food at various stages, including during production, processing, transportation, and storage.Foodborne illnesses can result from consuming contaminated raw or undercooked food, improper food handling and preparation, cross-contamination, and inadequate storage temperatures.Temperature control is crucial in preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms. The temperature danger zone for food is between 4 °C (40 °F) and 60 °C (140°F).Pasteurisation is a process that involves heating food to a specific temperature to kill or inactivate harmful microorganisms, while retaining the food’s quality.Fermentation is a process that uses beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, to convert sugars into alcohol or acids. Examples include yogurt, cheese, sauerkraut, and pickles.Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, provide health benefits. They are often found in fermented foods and are known to promote gut health.Food preservation techniques, such as canning, drying, and freezing, aim to prevent or slow down the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.Good hygiene practices, including proper handwashing, cleaning and sanitizing of surfaces, and maintaining personal hygiene, are essential in preventing the spread of microorganisms in food.Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a systematic approach used in the food industry to identify and control potential hazards related to food safety.Foodborne illnesses can have various symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and in severe cases, organ failure or death.Proper cooking temperatures are critical to ensure the elimination of harmful microorganisms. For example, poultry should reach an internal temperature of 74 °C (165 °F), while ground meat should reach 71 °C (160 °F).Cross-contamination can occur when raw foods come into contact with cooked or ready-to-eat foods, potentially transferring harmful microorganisms. Separate cutting boards and utensils should be used for raw and ready-to-eat foods.Some food products undergo a process called aseptic packaging, which involves sterilizing the food and packaging materials separately and then filling the sterile food into sterile containers.The pH level of a food product can influence the growth of microorganisms. Most bacteria prefer a neutral pH around 7, while some acid-tolerant bacteria can grow in low-pH environments.Food poisoning is a type of foodborne illness caused by the ingestion of toxins produced by certain bacteria, such asStaphylococcusaureusandBacilluscereus.Food intoxication occurs when the ingestion of food contaminated with live microorganisms leads to illness. Examples includeSalmonellaandCampylobacterinfections.Food allergies are immune responses triggered by specific proteins in food. They are not caused by microorganisms but can be influenced by cross-contamination or improper labeling.Botulism is a severe form of food poisoning caused by the toxin produced by the bacteriumClostridiumbotulinum. It can result from improperly canned or preserved foods.Fermented dairy products, such as yogurt and kefir, contain beneficial bacteria known as probiotics, which can contribute to a healthy gut microbiome.The use of antibiotics in livestock can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can potentially be transmitted to humans through contaminated food.The development of rapid diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing, has revolutionised the detection and identification of microorganisms in food.Food microbiologists often work closely with food scientists, food safety experts, and regulatory agencies to ensure the safety and quality of food products.Food recalls can occur when a product is found to be contaminated with harmful microorganisms or other hazards. They are initiated to protect public health.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, are used in the production of alcoholic beverages through the process of fermentation.Foodborne pathogens can survive and multiply in refrigerated environments, emphasising the importance of proper storage temperatures and practices.Cross-protective adaptations can occur between different microorganisms in food, where the presence of one microorganism inhibits the growth of another.Food fermentation can enhance the nutritional value of foods by increasing the availability of certain vitamins and minerals.Some moulds produce mycotoxins, which are toxic compounds that can contaminate food. Examples include aflatoxins, produced byAspergillusmolds, which can be found in nuts, grains, and spices.Biopreservation is a technique that uses naturally occurring microorganisms or their products to inhibit the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in food.The microbial composition of food can vary depending on factors such as the source of the food, processing methods, and storage conditions.Some beneficial bacteria, such as those in the genusLactobacillusandBifidobacterium, are commonly used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products.Foodborne illness outbreaks can occur when multiple people experience similar symptoms after consuming contaminated food from a common source.Food safety regulations and guidelines differ among countries and are often based on risk assessments and scientific evidence.The use of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) is being explored as a potential alternative to antibiotics for controlling bacterial pathogens in food.Some microorganisms, such as those in the genusSaccharomyces, are used in bread making and contribute to the fermentation process, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and alcohol.High-pressure processing (HPP) is a non-thermal food preservation technique that uses high pressure to inactivate microorganisms while retaining the nutritional value and quality of food.Microorganisms can form biofilms on food contact surfaces, making them more resistant to cleaning and sanitising agents.The presence of certain microorganisms, such asPseudomonasspp., can accelerate the spoilage of fresh produce.Foodborne illnesses can have significant economic impacts, including medical costs, loss of productivity, and damage to the reputation of food manufacturers.The study of foodborne pathogens and their transmission routes is essential for developing effective control strategies to prevent foodborne illnesses.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, can produce enzymes that enhance the flavor and texture of food products.Food safety training and education are vital for food handlers and consumers to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure proper food handling practices.Microbial testing is commonly used in the food industry to monitor the quality and safety of food products.Ongoing research in food microbiology aims to develop novel methods for microbial control, improve food preservation techniques, and enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and food.","food microbiologist, food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Fungi,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, fungi, yeast",Fermented vegetables for health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/fermented-vegetables-for-health/,"June 21, 2023","Tsukemonois a traditional Japanese term that refers to a variety of pickled vegetables. It is a popular side dish and condiment in Japanese cuisine, often served alongside meals to provide a balance of flavors and textures. Tsukemono can range from simple salted pickles to more complex, seasoned and fermented varieties.The process of making tsukemono typically involves preserving vegetables in a brine or salt to extract moisture and promote fermentation. This fermentation process can vary in duration, from a few hours to several months, depending on the desired flavor and texture. The brine or salt mixture may also contain additional seasonings like rice bran, vinegar, soy sauce, miso, or spices to impart different flavors.There are numerous types of tsukemono, each with its unique taste and characteristics. Some common examples include:Shibazuke: A popular tsukemono from Kyoto, made with cucumbers, eggplant, ginger, and perilla leaves, fermented in a sweet and sour purple-red brine.Takuan: Yellow pickled daikon radish, often sliced and served as a crunchy and slightly sweet accompaniment to rice or sushi.Umeboshi: Pickled Japanese plums that are salty, tangy, and sour in taste. They are commonly enjoyed as a condiment or added to rice balls (onigiri).Gari: Sweet and tangy pickled ginger often served with sushi to cleanse the palate between bites.Asazuke: Quick-pickled vegetables that are lightly salted and usually left to marinate for a short time, resulting in a crunchy texture and a refreshing flavor.Fukujinzuke: A mixed vegetable pickle typically used as a condiment for Japanese curry. It consists of various vegetables like daikon, lotus root, and cucumber, pickled in a soy-based sauce.Tsukemono can vary in taste, texture, and appearance depending on the region, ingredients, and preparation methods. They add a vibrant and refreshing element to Japanese meals, providing a balance of flavors to complement the main dishes.Escabecheis a traditional dish and cooking technique that has roots in Spanish cuisine but is also prevalent in Latin American, Filipino, and Mediterranean cuisines. The term “escabeche” refers to a method of preserving and flavoring food by marinating it in a vinegar-based sauce or marinade.In its most common form, escabeche typically involves fish or meat that is first cooked, then immersed in a marinade composed of vinegar, oil, onions, garlic, and various herbs and spices. The dish is then left to marinate for a period of time, allowing the flavors to meld together and the protein to absorb the tangy and aromatic characteristics of the marinade.The marinade used in escabeche can vary depending on the regional and cultural influences. Some common ingredients used in the marinade include:Vinegar: The primary acidic component of escabeche, vinegar provides the distinctive tangy flavor and acts as a preservative.Oil: Usually olive oil or vegetable oil, which adds richness and helps balance the acidity of the vinegar.Onions: Thinly sliced onions are often a key component of the marinade, imparting a sweet and savory flavor.Garlic: Crushed or minced garlic cloves are frequently added to enhance the overall flavor profile.Herbs and Spices: Bay leaves, oregano, thyme, peppercorns, and chili peppers are commonly used to season the marinade and add aromatic and spicy notes.The marinated protein, whether fish or meat, is typically served cold or at room temperature. The marinade not only imparts flavor but also acts as a preservative, allowing the dish to be enjoyed over an extended period. It is common to find escabeche served as an appetizer, a side dish, or even as a main course, accompanied by rice, bread, or other side dishes.Escabeche can be versatile, with variations in different regions and cultures. For example, in the Philippines, it is often made with fried fish and served as a popular dish called “escabeche de pescado.”Overall, escabeche offers a unique blend of flavors, combining the acidity of the vinegar, the richness of the oil, and the aromatic herbs and spices. It provides a tangy and savory addition to the culinary landscape.Pickled watermelon rindis a unique and flavorful food product made from the rind or peel of watermelon, which is typically discarded. Instead of being wasted, the rind is preserved and transformed into a tangy and sweet pickled delicacy.The process of making pickled watermelon rind involves removing the green outer skin and any remaining pink flesh from the watermelon rind. The rind is then typically cut into bite-sized pieces or strips, although shapes can vary depending on personal preference and regional traditions.The rind is then soaked in a brine solution containing vinegar, sugar, and various spices and seasonings. The brine helps to impart flavor, preserve the rind, and balance the natural sweetness with acidity. Commonly used spices and seasonings include cinnamon, cloves, ginger, allspice, and sometimes chili peppers for a touch of heat.After soaking in the brine for a period of time, which can range from a few days to several weeks, the watermelon rind absorbs the flavors and undergoes a transformation. The result is a pickled watermelon rind with a firm yet tender texture and a sweet and tangy taste profile. The rind retains some of its natural sweetness while being infused with the flavors of the brine and spices.Pickled watermelon rind is often enjoyed as a snack or side dish. It can be eaten on its own or paired with other foods like cheese or cured meats. In some regions, it is also used as a condiment or relish, adding a unique touch to sandwiches or salads.The pickling process not only enhances the flavor and texture of the watermelon rind but also helps to extend its shelf life, allowing it to be enjoyed for an extended period. It is a delightful example of utilizing a typically discarded part of the watermelon and transforming it into a delicious and versatile culinary treat.","fermentation, food microbiology, food preservation, food science, foods of the world"
Fungi,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, food-safety, fungi, viruses, yeast",The Food Safety Modernization Act: Transforming Food Safety Practices in the USA,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-food-safety-modernization-act-transforming-food-safety-practices-in-the-usa/,"June 7, 2023","Today, 7 June 2023, is World Food Safety Day, a day the World Health Organisation has set aside to focus on failings in food safety and to celebrate achievements in food safety.  This year’s theme is about how food standards in food safety save lives.  There’s no doubt that they do.  When one looks back to the 19th century, even, or maybe especially, in the the great industrialised nations of the modern world, up and coming food manufacturers, either out of ignorance or deliberately, manufactured foods that were certainly not in the public’s best interests.  While we don’t have the level of morbidity and mortality we once did, there’s no doubt that foodborne disease represents a totally unacceptable high amount of illness, death and economic burden in our communities.  What makes it even more difficult to understand is that foodborne illness is largely preventable, through the following of procedures, processes and protocols that have been developed following rigorous basic scientific research.  Thus, food standards at all levels (local, state, federal), play an absolutely critical role in safeguarding the food supply of a nation.In this article, we want to focus on the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), a turning point in food safety in the United States that came into being only 12 years ago.IntroductionFSMA, enacted in 2011, is a landmark legislation that revolutionized food safety practices in the United States. Designed to address the challenges posed by an increasingly complex and global food supply chain, the FSMA introduced a comprehensive framework to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure the safety of the nation’s food supply. This article examines the key provisions of the FSMA, its impact on the food industry, and the strides made in safeguarding public health through enhanced preventive measures and regulatory oversight.Overview of the FSMAThe FSMA shifted the focus of food safety in the USA from reactive measures to a proactive, preventive approach. It empowered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the authority to set stringent standards and regulations across the entire food supply chain, from farm to fork. The act encompasses several key components, including preventative controls, inspections, import safety, response to outbreaks, and enhanced partnerships.Preventive controlsOne of the cornerstones of the FSMA is the establishment of preventive controls to identify and address potential hazards before they can cause harm. This includes the implementation of Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) by food facilities. HARPC mandates a systematic approach to evaluate and prevent biological, chemical, and physical hazards in food production, processing, and distribution. It requires food manufacturers to develop and implement comprehensive food safety plans, conduct regular risk assessments, and institute preventive measures.Inspections and complianceThe FSMA introduced a risk-based inspection strategy to ensure compliance with food safety standards. It provided the FDA with increased authority to conduct inspections, sampling, and testing of food facilities. The act also mandated the establishment of a third-party certification program, enabling accredited auditors to assess and certify compliance with the FSMA requirements. Non-compliant facilities can be subject to corrective actions, penalties, and even product recalls if necessary.Import safetyRecognizing the importance of imported foods in the American market, the FSMA strengthened the FDA’s oversight of imported food products. It mandated the development of a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP), which places responsibility on importers to verify that their foreign suppliers meet U.S. safety standards. The act also granted the FDA authority to refuse entry to imported goods from non-compliant facilities and increased the frequency of inspections for high-risk products.Outbreak response and partnershipsIn the event of a foodborne illness outbreak, the FSMA equipped the FDA with enhanced tools to respond swiftly and effectively. It established a food tracing system to track and trace products throughout the supply chain, enabling rapid identification of the source of contamination. Furthermore, the FSMA emphasized collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies, as well as industry stakeholders, to share information and resources and foster a culture of proactive food safety practices.Impact and challengesThe FSMA has had a profound impact on the food industry, leading to improved food safety practices and reduced foodborne illnesses. By shifting the focus towards prevention, the act has encouraged proactive measures, such as better recordkeeping, increased training, and improved sanitation practices. However, implementing the FSMA’s requirements posed challenges for smaller farms and food facilities due to resource constraints and compliance costs. To address these concerns, the FDA has provided educational resources, technical assistance, and flexibility in certain compliance deadlines.ConclusionThe Food Safety Modernization Act has transformed the landscape of food safety in the USA. By prioritizing prevention, enhancing regulatory oversight, and fostering collaboration, the FSMA has made significant strides in safeguarding public health and strengthening consumer confidence in the nation’s food supply.

Fungi,"bacteria, food-quality, yeast",Spoilage of high acid fruit-based beverages,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/spoilage-of-high-acid-fruit-based-beverages/,"April 10, 2023","Introduction to food spoilage bacteria and their role in food deteriorationFood spoilage bacteria are microorganisms that cause undesirable changes in food, resulting in a decline in quality, texture, flavor, and color. These bacteria are ubiquitous, meaning they are present everywhere in the environment. They can enter the food chain through raw materials, processing, handling, and storage. When food spoilage bacteria grow and multiply in food, they produce various enzymes, acids, and other metabolites that lead to spoilage.Understanding the different types of food spoilage bacteriaThere are many types of food spoilage bacteria, but the ones that are most commonly associated with juice spoilage are thermophilic, thermoduric, and spore-forming bacteria.Thermophilic bacteria thrive in high-temperature environments and can survive pasteurisation. They cause spoilage in heat-processed beverages such as juice by producing heat-resistant enzymes that break down the carbohydrates and proteins present in the juice.Thermoduric bacteria can survive pasteurisation but do not grow at high temperatures. They can enter the processing plant through raw materials, equipment, and personnel. They cause spoilage by producing off-flavors and odors in the juice.Spore-forming bacteria are heat-resistant and can survive high-temperature processing. They can form dormant spores that can resist heat, drying, and other adverse conditions. When the conditions become favorable, the spores germinate and grow, causing spoilage in the juice.The impact of food spoilage bacteria on juice productsFood spoilage bacteria can cause various types of spoilage in juice products, such as:Cloudiness caused by bacterial growth and sedimentationOff-flavors and odors caused by the breakdown of organic compoundsGas production caused by bacterial fermentationColor changes caused by the breakdown of pigmentsThese changes can lead to a decline in quality, texture, and flavor of the juice, making it unsuitable for consumption.Factors that influence the growth and development of food spoilage bacteria in juiceSeveral factors can affect the growth and development of food spoilage bacteria in juice products, such as:pH: Most spoilage bacteria prefer a slightly acidic pH range, between 4.5 and 7.0.Water Activity: The availability of water in the juice can affect the growth of spoilage bacteria. The higher the water activity, the more favorable the conditions for bacterial growth.Nutrients: The presence of nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, and vitamins can support bacterial growth.Oxygen: The presence or absence of oxygen can influence the type of bacteria that grow in the juice.Temperature: The temperature at which the juice is stored can affect the growth rate of bacteria.The role of thermophilic and thermoduric bacteria in juice spoilageThermophilic and thermoduric bacteria are the most common types of spoilage bacteria in heat-processed beverages such as juice.

Fungi,"eukaryotic-microbiology, food-quality, fungi, yeast",Fungal contamination of food and how to control it,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/fungal-contamination-of-food-and-how-to-control-it/,"April 26, 2022","This is the final article in our series of fungal spoilage of food products, originally written by Doreen Ting from RMIT University in 2008.  As her project facilitator, I have made some changes to her piece below, but it is largely as per her original submission.Source of Spoilage YeastFood may be susceptible to spoilage with fungal contamination from a variety of sources. This may be from the environment (for example soil, air, and water) or from poor manufacturing process while intrinsic characteristics of the food (such as pH, water activity, and sugar concentration) can increase the likelihood of growth of these fungal contaminants (Ray, 2004; Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). The most commonly food spoiled by yeast, as mentioned earlier are fruits. Fruits, as received at processing plants, are often contaminated with large amounts of yeasts. In some cases, fruits that have been damaged before reaching processing plants, due to poor handling or damaged by birds or insects may contain significantly higher yeast populations (Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). Due to the exposed tissues of these damaged fruits, yeasts are introduced, thus enabling them to use the naturally occurring sugar and nutrients in the fruit to support their growth.Physiological characteristic of the food itself may also encourage the growth of yeast thus leading to spoilage. This may be due to several reasons, which includes: (i) pH value of food; (ii) water activity; and (iii) sugar concentration. Favourable growth conditions for yeast are in foods with low pH values (Martorell et al., 2006; Praphailong & Fleet, 1997;). As mentioned earlier, several species of the yeast genusZygosaccharomyces, were reported growing at a water activity level down to 0.62 (Frazier & Westhoff, 2005; Martorell et al., 2004) and some at a pH value as low as 2.5 (Steels et al., 1999). It is reported that food with a high concentration of sugars are also particularly at risk besides food with low pH (Tilbury 1980, cited in Steels et al. 1999; Thomas & Davenport, 1985; Tournas & Katsoudas; 2005).  As stated by Tournas & Katsoudas (2005), fruits in general contain high concentration of sugar favourable to yeast, which was mentioned earlier (i.e. glucose and fructose), the ideal water activity level with their low pH level thus making them particularly susceptible to spoilage by yeast.Poor manufacturing process may also contribute to spoilage of foods. Processing of food in a non-hygienic environment may lead to contamination of the food and thus leading to spoilage. Food produced in a non-hygienic environment introduces hazards, which can adversely affect the stability of the food product (Vasconcellos, 2004). Introduction of food spoilers at the very start of production increases the risk of food spoilage. Although most spoilers may be killed during processing especially during heat treatment, some yeast strains have the ability to survive in heat-stressed environment (Raso et al., 1998; Tran & Farid, 2004).As stated previously, the low pH of many fruits is the major factor that places them at risk of spoilage by yeast. Despite having most yeasts removed during early stages of processing (i.e. washing and peeling), recontamination can subsequently occur wherever there is opportunity for yeast to growth in later processing stages (Worobo & Splittstoesser, 2005). The use of contaminated equipments for processing (i.e. conveyor belts, slicers, fillers) are potential sources of contamination. Research conducted by Martorell et al. (2007) on yeast strains isolated from a high sugar environment (i.e. candied fruits and nougats) demonstrated resistance to preservatives however, did not show exceptional resistance to biocides such as peracetic acid and hypochlorite. The authors indicated that yeast spoilers might best be prevented through the use of biocidal agents in the factory rather than treating the food with preservatives. Food manufacturers are required to comply with the Codex Alimentarius: Recommended International Code of Practice – General Principles of Food Hygiene (Codex Alimentarius, 2003). In Australia, food manufacturers are required to operate in accordance with the Food Standards Australia New Zealand, which aims to control food safety hazards during production, manufacture, and handling of food (FSANZ, 2008).According to Tapia and Welti-Chanes (2002), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) systems are important tools used by the food industry for production of microbiologically safe food. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) involves general principles of hygiene whereas the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system involves identification of possible hazards and preventative measures necessary for the control of hazards (Vasconcellos, 2004).Control/Prevention MethodsAccording to Loureiro (2000), the consequence of food spoilage is a severe economical loss to the food industry because of the large scale at which food products are made. Due to its detrimental effects to the food industry, food microbiologists have continued to research on various methods in terms of controlling the growth of yeasts. As stated by van der Vossen & Hofstra (1996), it is advantageous to know the identity of the spoilage organism present in the product before designing strategies to prevent spoilage. Amongst the method used for identification and characterisation of spoilage yeast are: (i) analysis of long-chain fatty acids (Loureiro, 2000), and (ii) DNA based identification technology including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Casey & Dobson, 2003; Rawsthorne & Phister, 2006; Renard et al., 2008; van der Vossen & Hofstra, 1996) (iii) monitoring of isoenzymes patterns (Duarte et al., 2004; Loureiro, 2000).As mentioned earlier in the review, several yeast species are able to survive in stressed environments, which include presence of weak-acid preservatives. One species in particular known for its exceptional ability to resist weak-acid preservatives isZygosaccharomyces bailii(Andrews et al., 1997; Steels et al., 1999; Thomas & Davenport, 1985). Inactivation of this particular species was found only in environments with high levels of preservatives (El Halouat et al., 1998). However, due to legal limitations, researchers opted for combination of hurdles to achieve this. Though the mechanism of this has not been thoroughly understood, researchers have continued to carry out experiments on a combination of hurdles in preventing the growth of yeast in food. Weak-acid preservatives used along with pH adjustments (Cole & Keenan, 1986; Nielsen & Arneborg, 2007; Quintas et al., 2004), use of heat with combination of high hydrostatic pressure and pulsed electric field (Raso et al., 1998), and use of different type and amount of carbon source (Levya et al., 1999; Merico et al., 2003) were amongst the methods used in controlling the growth of yeast.Nevertheless, there has been increasing demand for foods with reduced amounts of chemical additives and less physical damage (Palou et al., 1997), in other words minimally processed food. This has lead researchers to investigate the use of modified atmospheric packaging as another alternative in preserving food products from yeast contaminants. Lucas (2003) view modified atmospheric packaging as a technique of shelf-life extension, which involves a mixture of gases including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Restuccia et al., (2006) reported that modified atmospheric packaging in combination with hurdles (i.e. temperature), work synergistically in maintaining freshness, extending shelf life and ensuring the safety of food. El Halouat & Debevere (1996), who conducted a research on the influence of modified atmosphere and preservatives on the growth ofZygosaccharomyces rouxiiisolated from dried fruits, reported on the synergistic effects of inhibiting factors such as low water activity level, preservatives and carbon dioxide. El Halouat et al. (1998) also found that modified atmospheric packaging enhanced the inhibitory effects of weak-acid preservatives used in preventing growth of yeast.Links to prior articles in this series and to the reference list of literature cited in this and/or prior articles.Food spoilage, with special reference to fruit productsBlog article published on 21 April 2022.Significance of yeast in food spoilage and their membrane transport systemsBlog article published on 19 February 2022.Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeastsBlog article published on 13 February 2022.Overall importance and general characteristics of food spoilage yeastBlog article published on 5 January 2020.Food spoilage yeast reference list","food microbiology, food preservation, food science, food spoilage, microbiology, mycology"

I had the privilege of guiding her on the preparation of this substantial piece of work, from which this is extracted from.  In this article, we provide an introduction to bacteria and other types of food spoilage, then delve deeper into spoilage of fruit products.  Such products, due to their origin and intrinsic conditions, tend to be, by and large, spoiled by non-bacterial organisms, almost exclusively fungi, which can be either yeasts and/or moulds.  This article provides some insights into that aspect.Bacterial vs. Non-bacterial SpoilageBacteria are the largest group of microorganism present while yeast is a member of the fungi kingdom.  Besides spoilage caused by yeast, food may also be spoiled by several forms of bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria and spore-forming bacteria (Worobo & Splittstoesser, 2005). Amongst the bacteria listed, lactic acid bacteria and yeast possess similarities in terms of the role they play, both beneficial and detrimental, in the food industry. Lactic acid bacteria and yeast both act as fermentors and both are also associated with spoilage of food. According to Vermeulan et al., (2008), microbial spoilage of acidified sauces stored at ambient temperature are predominantly caused by lactic acid bacteria and yeast. Regardless, both are still very different organisms. Lactic acid bacteria are able to proliferate when exposed to a given substrate that specifically suits their nutritional requriements and under storage conditions with low gas permeability (Farag & Korashy, 2006). Yeast on the other hand, especially the genusZygosaccharomyces, grow and survive in the presence of high concentrations of sugar (Cole & Keenan, 1986; Ludovico et al., 2002; Steels et al., 1999) and under optimum conditions, which includes low pH values (Cole & Keenan, 1986; Vermeulane et al., 2006), and low water activity level (Steels et al., 1999). Nevertheless, Levya et al. (1999) reported that different species ofZygosaccharomycesfavour different types of sugar.Z. bailiiwas found to be fructophilic (Levya et al. 1999; Vermeulan et al., 2008), favouring fructose and therefore metabolising fructose more rapidly compared to glucose. The ability of yeast to thrive in high salt or sugar concentrations environment sets it apart from bacteria. Therefore, they are capable of spoiling certain foods, in which bacteria are not able to grow.Spoilage caused by bacteria may result in organoleptic changes such as souring, slime formation, off-odour, off-flavours, and gas production (Farag & Korashy, 2006). This is most often seen in spoilage of raw meat by lactic acid bacteria. Yeast causes undesirable properties in food by producing off-flavours (Rodrigues et al., 2001), hazing (Rodrigues et al., 2001), emulsion breakage (dressings) (Vermeulan et al., 2008), gas production (Vermeulan et al., 2008), and ethanol production (Vermeulan et al., 2008).ZygosaccharomycesspeciesThe yeast genusZygosaccharomycesis noted for its infamous relationship with food spoilage.  According to Steels et al. (1999), this particular genus includes some of the most osmotolerant organisms known, yeasts which are able to vastly resist concentrations of food preservatives. The osmotolerant species, comprising ofZygosaccharomyces bailii,Zygosaccharomyces rouxiiandZygosaccharomyces bisporusare not only known for their fermentative spoilage in food with high sugar concentration, low water activity, and low pH value but also known for their heat resistance profiles (Chen & Tseng, 1996, Makdesi & Beuchat, 1996). According to Raso et al. (1998),Z. bailiihas the ability to form ascospores, which are more resistant to physical and chemical agents than vegetative cells, thus are also more resistant to heat.Food ProductsFoods are considered habitats for microbial growth. Food products commonly spoiled by yeast range from fresh (raw) fruits to soft drinks. Fruit juices and soft drinks impose an adverse environment for most microorganisms. This is due to their low pH value and low nitrogen and oxygen contents (Deak & Beuchat, 1996). These beverages however have been found to be excellent substrates for growth of yeasts. Fruit juices in particular are found to be most susceptible to yeast spoilage (Keyser et al., 2007; Elez-Martinez et al., 2004; Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). Tran & Farid (2004) stated in their research that yeast is one of the most common spoilers found in fruit juices (i.e. orange juice). Other high sugar foods such as honey, syrups, jams, jelly, and dried fruits are also susceptible to spoilage by yeast (Deak & Beuchat, 1996).Fruit productsAccording to Deak & Beuchat (1996), yeast form a part of the natural microflora of most fruits, which is usually found on the external surface of fruits. Fruits are high in nutrients and moisture content. Its low pH (3 to 5) sets them apart from vegetables in terms of susceptibility to spoilage by yeast.  In addition, fruits are high in soluble carbohydrates, increasing their desirability to yeast as compared to vegetables. Therefore, weak-acid preservatives are widely used in high-sugar, low pH products such as fruit juices in which spoilage are most often caused by yeast. Weak-acid preservatives commonly used in the food industry such as sorbic acid, benzoic acid, propionic acid, acetic acid, and sulphur dioxide (Martorell et al., 2006) has been found to be of little use in preserving food products from spoilage unless a significant level of preservative is added to the food (Martorell et al., 2006). However, a constraint faced in this case is the legal limitation on level of preservative addition.Despite its benefits in reducing risk of obtaining chronic diseases, fruits are still consumed less especially by the younger generation (Ness & Powles, 1997; Steinmetz & Potter, 1996). Studies have shown that not everyone is interested in consuming the recommended dietary intake of fruits (Betts et al., 2003; Padula et al., 2003). Therefore, for many decades, health professionals have collaborated with food manufacturers in developing food products, in hopes of helping people change their dietary habits. This has lead to creation of different food products consisting of fruits, such as fruit juices and fruit yoghurt. However, due to this fast-paced world we currently live in, consumer demands has also moved to a different level. Consumers now demand fruit products, which are convenient and ready-to-eat, however, still containing sufficient nutrients for the recommended dietary intake. Consumer demand has lead to the production of minimally processed fruits. According to Alzamora et al. (2000), minimally processed fruits are products that maintain their attributes and quality similar to those of fresh products, which include dried fruits. The purpose of minimally processed fruits according to Laurila & Ahvenainen (2002) is: (i) to keep produce fresh, without losing its nutritional quality and; (ii) to ensure a product shelf life is sufficient to make distribution feasible within a region of consumption.Dried FruitsDried fruits are one of the most notable minimally processed food products on the market. A high concentration of sugar, low water activity level and low pH value of dried fruits causes it to be one of the food products susceptible to yeast spoilage (El Halouat, 1996). With its high concentration of sugar and its low water activity level, dried fruits are particularly at risk of spoilage by the genusZygosaccharomyces. As sulphur dioxide is most commonly used in preservation of dried fruits (Florin et al., 1993), some species of the genusZygosaccharomyceshave been found to be resistant to this preservative (Martorell et al., 2005; Thomas & Davenport, 1985).Fruits are dried to reduce the water activity level to less than 25% (Worobo & Splittstoesser, 2005), as fruit product usually will not spoil when the water activity level is below 0.65 (Corry 1987, cited in Worobo & Splittstoesser 2005; Pitt & Hocking, 1985).  El Halouat & Debevere (1997) found thatZygosaccharomyces rouxiiwere among the dominant contaminants isolated from high moisture prunes and raisins. High moisture according to Worobo & Splittstoesser (2005) is having a water activity level of at least 35%.Links to prior articles in this series and to the reference list of literature cited in this and/or prior articles.Significance of yeast in food spoilage and their membrane transport systemsBlog article published on 19 February 2022.Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeastsBlog article published on 13 February 2022.Overall importance and general characteristics of food spoilage yeastBlog article published on 5 January 2020.Food spoilage yeast reference list","food microbiology, food preservation, Food quality, food science, food spoilage"
Fungi,yeast,Significance of yeast in food spoilage and their membrane transport systems.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/significance-of-yeast-in-food-spoilage-and-their-membrane-transport-systems/,"February 19, 2022","This is a (barely edited) extract of a lengthly literature review written by a 3rd-year food science and technology student, Doreen Ting, at RMIT University in 2008 – I (Dr Philip Button) was her project facilitator.  The overall literature review is excellent, and despite its age, at 14 years old now, it will still serve a purpose as a review of the fundamental elements of key food spoilage yeasts.  On 5 January 2020, we published a blog article as part 1 in this series, giving an overview of the significance of yeasts in this context.  On 13 February 2022 we published about the physiology and biochemistry of yeasts in the context of food spoilage.  We won’t label this and subsequent articles as parts, but shall provide links to them, and to a separate document which contains all the literature cited.  In this article, we cover of the overall significance of yeast in a food spoilage context, as well as providing insights into the specific physiological system of membrane transport.  To be successful on numerous fronts, microbial membrane transport systems are key, and here we provide an introduction to these.Significance of yeast in food spoilageYeast are known to be one of the major spoilers in the food industry. Apart from their outstanding role in processes such as leavening of bread and fermentation of wine, yeast has caused vast losses to the food industry. It is able to grow in a wide range of food; high (syrups) to low (beverages) viscosity food, high sugar to high salt content food, and solid food such as fruits.As mentioned earlier, the yeast genusZygosaccharomycesis most notable in the food industry for having three species that poses serious economic spoilage risks to food manufacturers. Some yeast are able to thrive in harsh environments including environments with high levels of preservatives. The three species areZygosaccharomyces bailii,Zygosaccharomyces rouxiiandZygosaccharomyces bisporus. These three species are therefore regarded as osmotolerant (El Halouat & Debevere, 1996).Among the three species,Z. bailiipossess the most distinct and diversified antimicrobial resistance characteristics. A major yeast contaminant spoiling foods and beverages such as mayonnaise, pickles, dried fruits (Verma & Joshi, 2000; Deak & Beuchat, 1996), fruit concentrates (Thomas & Davenport, 1985), soft drinks and wines (Thomas & Davenport, 1985),Z. bailiiis known for its exceptional tolerance to preservatives, high sugar, low acid and pasteurisation regimes (Thomas & Davenport, 1985).Yeast have created undesirable properties in food products including off flavours (Rodrigues et al., 2001), hazing (Rodrigues et al., 2001), emulsion breakage (Encyclopaedia of Food Microbiology 1999, p. 2362), and brown film development on surfaces of food products (Encyclopaedia of Food Microbiology 1999, p. 2362).Z. bailiiis known to metabolise much aggressively compared to the other two species,Z. rouxiiandZ. bisporus. This not only has caused spoilage of food but also has lead to explosion of canned and bottled foods and beverages on the shelf (Levya et al., 1998; Oda et al., 2006). In terms of Occupational Health & Safety, explosion of canned and bottled food products on the shelf are significant as there is a risk of injury (Grinbaum et al. 1994, cited in Steels et al. 1999), which may also cause the company to be exposed to contentious liability issues.Yeast membrane transportThe purpose of yeast membrane transporters can be divided into several aspects: (i) nutrient uptakes (sugar, amino acids, and vitamins) (Belle & Andre, 2001); (ii) importing and exporting of proteins or peptides (Andre, 2004); (iii) exporting of toxic compounds from the cell to prevent any deleterious reaction (Demidchik, Macpherson & Davies, 2004). According to Munn (2000),Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the baker’s yeast, has been widely used as the model organism for the study of many cellular processes, which includes the yeast membrane transport system.The ability of certain yeasts to grow in a low pH environment with the presence of weak-acid preservatives has inflicted heavy losses to the food and beverage industry. Macpherson et al. (2005) believes that understanding the mechanisms of this resistance is the key in developing more effective food and beverage preservation methods. El Halouat & Debevere (1996) stated in their findings that at low pH, an active transport system is induced to remove both hydrogen ions and preservative anions from the cell. Both the hydrogen ions and preservative anions in the product of the dissociation of weak-acid preservatives in the cell (Pampulha & Loureiro-Dias, 1989).Macpherson et al. (2005) conducted a research on the weak-acid preservative resistance of bothSaccharomyces cerevisiaeandZygosaccharomyces bailii. Their research aims to investigate the uptake of potassium cation (K+) by both strains on long-term exposure to benzoic acid. Macpherson et al. (2005) concluded in their findings that long-term exposure to benzoic acid leads to accumulation of potassium cation (K+) by bothSaccharomyces cerevisiaeandZygosaccharomyces bailii, which improved the growth of both strains in the presence of preservative. In the presence of weak-acid preservatives, the plasma membrane H+-ATPase pumps protons out of the cell, which contributes to the inhibition of weak-acid preservatives from toxicating cells.According to Pribylova et al. (2008), K+is required for many physiological functions whereas a high concentration of sodium cation (Na+)is toxic for most cells. A research on the plasma membrane of salt tolerant yeastZygosaccharomyces rouxiihas shown that in order to maintain an optimal cytoplasmic concentration of K+and a stable high intracellular ratio of K+/Na+, the yeast cells possess a transport system, which participate in both detoxication from excess sodium cations and the maintenance of potassium homeostasis and intracellular pH (Pribylova et al., 2008). As mentioned previously, K+assists in the growth of yeast cells by stabilising their intracellular pH despite the presence of weak-acid preservatives. This is also known as the Na+/H+-antiporter system (Pribylova et al., 2008). Watanabe et al. (1999) reported that the Na+/H+-antiporter system ofZygosaccharomyces rouxiihas enabled it to survive in environments with high salt concentration as the system extrudes Na+across the plasma membrane of the cell.Links to related articles and to the reference list of literature cited in this and/or related articles.Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeastsBlog article published on 13 February 2022.Overall importance and general characteristics of food spoilage yeastBlog article published on 5 January 2020.Food spoilage yeast reference list","biology, cell biology, food microbiology, food preservation, Food quality, food science, food spoilage, Fungi, microbiology, mycology"

Fungi,"probiotics-and-gut-health, yeast",How we address scientific challenges today,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/how-we-address-scientific-challenges-today/,"May 17, 2021","Long gone are the days when microbiologists worked in isolation and produced single-author original research papers, perhaps with the help of a technical assistant or research assistant.  Not only are demands on researchers seemingly greater than they were 100+ years ago, but research today is vastly different from what it was.  Multidisciplinary teams and Interdisciplinary research is the norm, and were not just talking about a team of microbiologists with different interests and different specialties, no I’m talking of teams spanning diverse disciplines in science, and even non-science, sometimes geographically separated by thousands of kilometres and multiple timezones.  Take for example, a project team I was part of at RMIT University several years ago – despite being a food microbiologist, I held a position in the School of Business IT and Logistics, where I worked (in the one project!) with e-commerce and innovative retailing experts, information systems professionals and environmental scientists trained in life cycle analysis (Figure 1).Fig. 1How are we leveraging the diverse expertise across different disciplines’ cross industry and academic 9and private research organisations) and breaking geographical barriers along with cross-cultural differences to advance science, and indeed society.  Really, that is all part of modern day science, and why diverse networking is an essential element of modern research and development pursuits.Another example I want to offer is my postdoctoral work, carried out in the School of Applied Sciences at RMIT University.  While we were all food scientists, I was a food microbiologist working in the Food Chemistry research group on projects in the area of physical chemistry and materials science, with experts in the area of rheology and calorimetric properties of food ingredients.  What might be the connection you may say, between food microbiology and materials science?  In this day and age, almost any discipline has an overlap and influence with another discipline, when talking of applied science and applied research as opposed to basic and fundamental science – which still may diversely multidisciplinary.Let me explain one example of a food scientist working at the interface of microbiology, physical chemistry and materials science.  One’s microbiome is an essential microbial ecosystem unique to the individual that functions in maintaining balance, not only in relation to guy or digestive health, but in other body systems too, even mental health as we are not coming to understand.  As a result of a range of factors, such as antibiotic-based abuse of our microbiome, our body’s microbial ecosystem may get out of balance, resulting in health disruptions, such as the rise and dominance of a pathogenic microorganism, no longer kept in check by ‘friendly’ bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract.  The area of probiotics, gut health and fermented foods is ancient, but enjoying a resurgence in popularity as people seek increasing natural ways to restore and maintain their health.  A traditional approach to restoring the gut bacterial balance is through probiotics consumed in food products, traditionally dairy products.  However, many issues have been raised with survival and the maintenance of viability of probiotic microorganisms in the sometimes harsh conditions found in food products (low pH), manufacturing (high temperature) and gastrointestinal passage (low pH), where sometimes, few viable cells reach the location of the gastrointestinal tract where they need to exert their effects.  While in various situations, basic studies on the microbiology of stress responses have elucidated elements of how tolerance (or lack of) to such conditions occurs, there is still a need for improved viability and survival of the diverse probiotics available, under the widely variable conditions found in products, manufacturing along with storage/distribution.  One approach that has been used in the food industry for delivery of sensitive compounds in found is encapsulation of various types, traditionally microencapsulation, but now encapsulation (Figure 2) on a nano scale – nano encapsulation.  There are many approaches with regard to encapsulation material and how the capsules are prepared that promote improved probiotic survival under different conditions.  Culture preparation is another factor that may be important in the ultimate survival of those encapsulated cells.  For example, in some circumstances, freeze dried cultures can be added to microcapsules, and perform better, with regard to tolerance to extreme environmental conditions, such as those encountered in food, during processing and in gastrointestinal passage.  To ensure that the highest concentration of viable cells possible is applied to the capsule, a cryoprotectant is typically selected that will allow the highest viability following freeze drying.  Certainly, in some cases,  forSachharomyces boulardii, this information is not known and consequently, we are likely to be missing out on maximising the effect of microencapsulation.  Thus, basic studies on cryoprotectants to determine, for example, important physical properties like the glass transition temperature (Figure 3) may be critical in advancement of this area of food science and highlights the cross disciplinary approach that can address a range of real-world problems to advance science.  Therefore, diverse networking and collaboration is essential – why not contact someone new today and expand your professional network?Fig. 2Fig. 3","food microbiology, food science, food scientist, materials science, physical chemistry, probiotics, research"
Fungi,"bacteria, food-quality, fungi, yeast",Complexities of shelf-life extension,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/complexities-of-shelf-life-extension/,"January 18, 2021","Food spoilage and the subsequent waste is costly.  The convenience of a long shelf-life benefit all along the supply chain from farm to fork.  Therefore, it is understandable that many start-up food manufacturers undergoing initial, or advanced, prototype development wish to extend the shelf-life of their product, for obvious reasons – today’s post-manufacture supply chains can be long and complex, and expensive too, especially if a cold chain is required.  Thus, achieving a lengthy shelf-life at ambient temperature is many people’s dream!  This also holds true for established food manufacturers, particularly when seeking new, more distant markets (especially in climate locations where temperature control is unreliable) or attempting to become a better proposition for selling in a physical, ‘brick and mortar’ store, where retailers wish to display for as long as possible to avoid price reductions due to food passing its Best Before date, hence cutting into their profit margin.It is not uncommon to look at shelf-life extension or optimisation, largely in terms of the finished product.  What can we do to the food to have it last longer?  Process differently or include preservatives are the two most common thoughts that come to mind when people look at approaches to increase shelf-life, although more brand owners are considering reformulation as a way to lengthen shelf-life.  Ultimately, reformulation should achieve one of two outcomes; I) provide some kind of an antimicrobial substance or II) alter the intrinsic conditions of the food such that the microorganisms cannot grow or grow more slowly.  Natural antimicrobial substances, such as from the inclusion of botanical essential oils (Figure 1) or bacteriocins are examples of such antimicrobial substances that will exert a preservation effect.Figure 1: The four best antibacterial botanic essential oils.If we consider the intrinsic conditions, this is where are really getting back to basics, basic microbial physiology that is learn during introductory microbiology classes … meaning their are factors which govern microbial growth and if these factors cannot be met, the microbes cannot grow, it really is as simple as that.  Examples of such factors are pH and water activity (Figure 2) and in turn, there are various ways to achieve these.  Water activity for example, can be lowered through an increase in salts or sugars.  Really though, the best indicators as to the shelf-life of a food and what is able to spoil it is pH and water activity.  Temperature as an extrinsic factor (Figure 2) can then offer further shelf-life benefits.Figure 2: Some intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors that can influence shelf-life.Water activity is a concept that is sometimes misunderstood, yet plays an absolutely critical role in the shelf-life properties of a product.  So what is water activity?  Is it the same as moisture?  Why is it even important?  Let me delve into these a little – moisture is the water content overall, but within what is considered moisture, there is water bound to food molecules and the like and free water in the food product.  It is this free water, and this free water only, that is available for microbial growth – it is measure on a scale between 0 (minimum) and 1 (maximum) (Figure 3).  Therefore, the concepts of moisture (total water content) and water activity (amount of free water that is able to be used by microorganisms for their growth) are related but different.  While moisture may give an indication of water activity, you cannot be sure, thus it is water activity, which is the definitive measure as to how much water is available in a food product to support growth of microorganisms.Figure 3: Water activity scale.However, if one is really going to optimise shelf-life then a myriad of other factors come into play, right from farm to fork.  While HACCP is the way that food safety risks can be managed and minimised, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) during primary production (Figure 4) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) during manufacture are key elements to ‘squeeze’ every possible amount of shelf-life out of a product.  As a result, shelf-life optimisation needs to be considered in context of the entire agrifood farm to fork supply chain.  There are not a lot of practices that many consider as impactful on shelf-life.  As examples, farm hygiene, manufacturing environment design and airflow are some which might be forgotten as what needs to be considered to optimise one’s product’s shelf-life.  Furthermore, practices of workers is key, as are Standard Operating Practices (SOPs), which may need to be reviewed and updated.Figure 4: Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)Thus, many, many factors come into play when looking extending or optimisation the shelf-life of a food product.  It isn’t as straight-forward as changing processing conditions or adding in some preservatives.  There’s no doubt that it is a complex process requiring painstaking consideration and analysis of primary production, your suppliers, transport, manufacturing environment, personnel, retail conditions and possible temperature and other abuse by consumers during domestic transport and storage.  Therefore, knowing that these factors could be influential isn’t enough to optimise or extend shelf-life, it is vital to know how these factors could come into play in decreasing the shelf-life of your specific product.","food microbiology, food preservation, food spoilage, shelf life"

Search interest from Australia (5th) and New Zealand (6th) still ranks highly, although the United States (2nd) and Canada (4th) rank higher, with Singapore at number three.  Perhaps surprising is Trinidad and Tobago at number one – small sample size perhaps?  In any case, kombucha and probiotics are of much interest, particularly from westernised nations of the world with advanced economies.Figure 1: Global Google Trends for “kombucha”.Figure 2: Top five countries searching for “kombucha” on Google Trends.Figure 3: Global Google Trends for “probiotic”.Figure 4: Top five countries for “probiotic” on Google Trends.This strong interest, resurgence is fascinating, given the age-old origins of both kombucha and provides, essentially stretching back millennia for kombucha in particular.  At this stage I want to introduce the distinction between probiotic foods and beverages and fermented foods and beverages.  While there is certainly overlap, in many instances, they are certainly not interchangeable terms.  Let us just consider that all foods/beverages could be categorised as:Fermented and probiotic – for example most yogurts and kimchi.Non-fermented and probiotic – for example some popcorn and some protein bars.Fermented and non-probiotic – for example natural kombucha and sourdough bread.Non-fermented and non-probiotic – for example peanut butter or ice cream.Kombucha is naturally, a fermented and non-probiotic beverage (tea) of ancient Chinese origin with consumption for “magical” properties being known from the Qin dynasty (around 220 BC) with subsequent historical consumption in China, Germany and Russia (Greenwaltet al., 2000).  However even today, despite mass consumption as a functional food for various postulated health benefits, no real evidence of any health benefits exists in the human contextin vivoalthough promising results have been seenin vitroand with animal models (Figure 5) (Moraleset al., 2020).Figure 5: Laboratory testing, animal models and human success to demonstrate health benefits of kombucha. Source: Morales et al. (2020).Kombucha is produced by what is referred to as a SCOBY, aSymbioticCultureOfBacteria andYeasts and is widely known in consumer circles as “tea fungus” (Figure).  Within this symbiotic community (Figures 6 and 7), bacterial diversity is limited to mostly species ofAcetobacterwhile a myriad of yeast species are likely to be present (Teohet al., 2004).  A detailed review by Moraleset al.(2020) has identified the following microorganism groups isolated from kombucha; 22 species of acetic acid bacteria from six genera, 3 species of lactic acid bacteria from two genera and 41 species of yeast from 21 genera –AcetobacterandGluconacetobacterare the bacterial genera with the most species isolated from kombucha whileHanseniasporaandZygosaccharomycesare the yeast genera with the most species isolated.Figure 6: An advanced fermentative state of kombucha (Source: Jayabalanet al., 2014).Figure 7: Microscopic view of SCOBY.  Source: Greenwaltet al.(2000).So, while kombucha is indeed a fermented beverage, it is not fermented with probiotic microorganisms – it is fermented with yeasts and acetic acid bacteria that do not have any demonstrated probiotic benefit.  Therefore, their only role is to turn tea into kombucha through their growth and metabolic activity, thus producing a variety of compounds in the process (Figure 8).  Thus, while you may in fact be consuming live culture in kombucha, these microorganisms that have been used to make kombucha will do little for your gut wellbeing.  From studies conducted on the microbial content of kombucha, there is admittedly some lactic acid bacteria present sometimes, however while they MAY be probiotic, they are most likely present at too low a concentration to confer any health benefit to to the host, which is of course a key element of the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of probiotics.Figure 8: How acetic acid bacteria and yeast ferment tea into kombucha.  Source: Tranet al.(2020).Manufacturers have thus sought to capitalise on the probiotic image of kombucha through the addition of probiotics to the product, that have no role in actually making the product.  This is fine, but it’s worth knowing that such probiotics are an additive because as mentioned above, they do not function in the fermentation process.  Therefore, from this perspective, kombucha has little difference from any other probiotic food or drink to which probiotics are added, to make them probiotic products, of which there are diverse types on the market these days, such as popcorn (Figure 9).Figure 9: A probiotic popcorn product on sale in a Melbourne supermarket. Photo by @pdbuttonLast point, read the science, believe the science and remember to only trust credible sources so as not to be misled by erroneous information that is more easily found online (Figure 10).  While kombucha might be delicious, they are not naturally probiotic and need to be made probiotic through the addition of probiotics (therefore, read the label and see if it is probiotic or a fermented beverage only) and there is certainly no robust evidence that kombucha has any human health benefits, despite such claims below in the popular health media online.Figure 10: An erroneous “blanket” reference to the probiotic and other health properties for all kombucha products.ReferencesGreenwalt, C.

Fungi,"food-quality, food-safety, fungi",Spoiled retail chicken.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/spoiled-retail-chicken/,"May 27, 2020","Woolworths responds after shopper’s ‘absolutely disgusting’ find in chicken — 7NEWS.com.auAs a food microbiologist specialising in food safety, food spoilage, food quality and food preservation, this recent news report (link above) from earlier this month was of particular interest to me.  First of all, I want to provide a response to four particular parts of that news story, then give a general commentary from my perspective.Posting photos appearing to show the mould spots to Facebook, James says he was lucky to spot the problem with the chicken – which was still well within the “best before” period – before eating it.Initially when I saw this reference to a “Best Before” date, I assumed the consumer had got expiry dates mixed up and he actually meant “Use By”, because I understand there is still a great degree of confusion amongst consumers regarding expiry dates on food.  So, in any case, this news story has a photo of the chicken packet and indeed, the expiry date is “Best Before”.  This leads me to ask, why is it a “Best Before” date and not a “Use By” date?  There are major differences between these two expiry dates with “Best Before” dates referring to product quality as impacted by food spoilage while “Use By” dates refer to product safety (Figure 1).  A product has its best quality guaranteed up to the “Best Before” date, after which date it is still safe to consume, but there may be some quality deviation from what consumers expect.  For example in colour or texture.  However,  “Use By’ dates refer to food safety considerations.  After the “Use By” date, food should not be consumed as its safety is not guaranteed.  Chicken is one of the foods, maybe the number food, that has the highest contamination potential from a food safety perspective.  Campylobacter and Salmonella are often seen in the top two microorganisms responsible for foodborne disease, in many countries … and which food(s) are typically vehicles of transmission?  Poultry and poultry products.  Thus, chicken is very much a potential food safety hazard, and it should have a “Use By” date rather than a “Best Before date”.Figure 1: The difference between Use By and Best Before.2.“The mould has been growing for at least a couple of days and it still had two days until the expiry date!I’m sorry, but is this guy a mycologist or a general microbiologist?  How does he know it had been growing for “at least a couple of days” when the product was stored at refrigeration temperature?  I can tell you, if mould spores germinated at refrigeration temperature, you certainly would not see any visible (not to the naked human eye anyway!) growth.  After two days, growth would still be microscopic.  It just amuses me when someone from the general public, who doesn’t know bacteria from mould and thinks you can get sick from growth of food spoilage microorganisms, makes comments like this.3. “Maybe the product was not handled or stored properly (not refrigerated correctly either during transport or once arriving to the store maybe?) which caused the bacteria/mould to grow, which again means the product should not have been sold.This is what I mean where he doesn’t know whether he has seen bacterial growth or mould growth.  Then, trying to identify where in the supply chain the cold chain was broken.  Just stick to the facts and not dramatise it all and don’t try to point fingers when you don’t know where to point them.4.“If myself and my family had eaten this we could have gotten very sick, and that is not good enough. We expect better.”…and here, I leave the best one until last!  He thinks they could have become sick from consuming some (minor) spoiled food.  If it is common for the general public to think that they can become sick from eating spoiled food, then we have a big issue on our hands of trying to bust some pretty big myths.  For the record, let it be known that spoiled food is generally speaking, safe to eat – I have no problem with eating a small amount of mouldy food for example.  While it might be safe to eat, the main issue will be based on quality, as the food may be unpalatable.  Just think, if foodborne disease was caused by spoiled food, then foodborne disease would rarely occur, right?  However it doesn’t.  Foodborne disease is caused pathogenic microorganisms that have grown in or on a food without causing detectable changes to the food.  This is why and how it is so easy to come down with a foodborne disease, because we just don’t know when we might consume an infectious dose of pathogenic microorganisms!Overall, I think this has just highlighted the degree of scientific literacy in Australian society.  Clearly, as food science professionals, we have some work to do in the area of public awareness.  One undervalued area in food science and technology is its crossover with supply chain management and logistics.  Many people I feel, just cannot appreciate the complexities of modern agrifood supply chains (Figure 2).  People at each and every step of the often long and involved agrifood supply chain for a given product are doing there best, and unfortunately, once in a blue moon, a mishap occurs.  Now, that is no reason to ‘crucify’ someone over this.  This is especially so when one consider the impeccable food safety and food spoilage record of primary producers, logistics and retailers and that spoilage of food and safety breaches are more likely to occur in the domestic environment, yes, carelessness in our homes is more likely to result in spoiled food, wasted food and foodborne disease due to cross-contamination and temperature control.Figure 2: An example agrifood supply chain.","chicken, consumers, food microbiology, food spoilage, retail"

Therefore, there’s no doubt that microbiologists are particularly valuable at the moment.  Especially virologists and those microbiologists that have an understanding of infectious diseases, public health and/or epidemiology.  Plus, some knowledge of immunology can be helpful to for vaccine development as can pharmacology for drug development.  However, it’s really the microbiologists that are coming to the fore.  People talk about ‘saving the world’ and about the impact and importance of careers, but microbiologists really can save the world.  If you had any doubt about the importance of a career in microbiology, then just consider what is happening in the world now and what has happened since December.  …and we’re not just talking about personal and public health, but livelihoods and the global economy.  The economy has gone ‘pear-shaped’ because of a microbiological phenomenon, something that could be stopped by microbiologists, if they are, or were given the opportunity.  The power is in the hands of microbiologists and those with an intricate understanding of microbiology, to save the world, I have no doubt about that.  So, if you want a powerful career, an impactful career, a highly significant career, then consider microbiology!A FOOD MICROBIOLOGY CAREERHow about a career in food microbiology?  What might that look like and what might one be involved with?  Well even in food microbiology there are many varied areas to work in.  The three key areas are: i) food safety, ii) food spoilage/food quality and iii) fermented foods, probiotics and gut health.  Each of these has highly significant impacts on society and on the economy.  Let’s look at each of these in more detail.What is food safety?Food safety is all about ensuring the safety of the food supply.  This means monitoring, auditing, regulating and developing policy for the purposes of safeguarding raw materials and manufactured food over the entire agrifood supply chain from ‘farm to fork’ or ‘paddock to plate’ as the concept goes.  Food safety microbiologists closely associate with epidemiologists, public health professionals and infectious disease experts to combat prevention, tracking and limiting the spread of foodborne diseases of epidemic proportions.What is food spoilage and food quality?Spoilage and subsequent wastage of food results in substantial economic losses.  In countries with developing economies, such spoilage and waste of food is more likely to be fresh produce and thus postharvest and pre-manufacure losses.  In countries with advanced economies, the situation is quite different, with substantial spoilage and waste taking place at the consumer level.  Tight supply chains along with excellent mechanisms of food preservation mean that spoilage losses in such countries are at a minimum.What are fermented foods, probiotics and gut health?This area is closely linked with personal health and wellness.  There is a sustained food trend in the area of probiotics as functional foods, along with prebiotics and people realise the great benefits of how one’s gut health contributes to overall health and wellbeing.  Related to this are fermented foods, many of which are probiotic, and as such, are rich natural sources of ‘good’ bacteria.CAREER PROFILE OF A FOOD MICROBIOLOGISTWondering how a career in food microbiology might actually look like in reality?  Well, I had a Q & A session with Lucy Lam, a food safety auditor from Taipei, Taiwan.  Let’s find out what Lucy’s food microbiology career looks like…What qualification(s) do you hold and from where?Master of Science, with a major in food, nutrition and technology, from The Chinese University of Hong KongBachelor of Food Science, from The University of MelbourneYour present position and where?Auditor, Bureau Veritas Certification  (Taiwan)How would you describe your career ‘in a nutshell’?A passion for food safety and quality control along with being good at problem solving. 1. Interest in manufacturing in any field, especially the food industry 2. Looking forward to opportunities to be involved more in food product development.Describe what you do you do on a day-to-day basis?As an auditor, I follow back office schedules to visit clients and conduct on-site audit. Before and after the audit, preparation of the report document is needed.How do you gain most satisfaction in your food microbiology career?When I gained the most hands-on experience in food microbiology when I was working in the food industry between 2013 – 2018. As I was a laboratory supervisor and department assistant manager, I had to oversee the operation of the laboratory including lab supplies, SOPs, good laboratory practices and third party laboratory compliances.What can you forsee as big challenges in your particular area of food microbiology?Food microbiology testing can be regarded as a quality control gate for product release and assurance in food industry. Hence the testing lead time will be demanding and tends to be “quick and accurate”. It is believed that rapid test kits or rapid test methods will be upcoming trends in food microbiology testing.Some advice about a career in food microbiology?It is suggested people who wish to be a food microbiologist must have basic food knowledge, and willing to do a lot of research and study.So there you have it, whether it’s building the health of individuals through improving gut health, ensuring public health is maintained through a safe food supply or curbing the substantial economic losses through food spoilage and food waste, there are multiple ways to save the world as a food microbiologist!

We’ve teamed up to share our understanding of the food product development process to assist accomplished home cooks, home cooks that have an idea that they may want to pursue commercialisation of a much-loved home cooked dish.  Dr Timilsena has contributed the section on the practice of food product development, whereas I have written on the principles of food product development.Figure 1: The front cover of my forthcoming book.For an insight into our soon to be released forthcoming joint publication, I’ve provided the below text below, which is an extract from the book.  Specifically, it is from section 3.3 “Shelf-life and food spoilage” within the third chapter, titled “Design and development”.

It’s of biological origin and is produced in the agricultural environment. Therefore, the presence of microorganisms on and sometimes in the raw material, along with the finished food product, is unavoidable.  Of course there are many instances of product contamination that are avoidable.  Biofilms on processing equipment, non-aseptic filling and poor hygiene practices of food processing line workers are instances of avoidable contamination. When one considers potential for microbial contamination, there are vast differences between commodities, with each type of raw material and finished product having its own characteristic microflora and spoilage, as well as safety considerations. This reflects the natural flora of the primary production environment and of the prevailing conditions within the food, the conditions which can dictate growth and hence the type of microorganisms that grow there. Shelf-life, what limits it and how best to extend it, is a complex process in which many factors come into play. Each factor needs to be considered individually, then in concert with one another, and not just at a single point in time, but how these factors play out along the usually complex agrifood supply chain with the dynamic microbial communities present.It’s important to reach a stage of relative satisfaction with regard to a so-called ‘base’ formulation for your product. A formulation that one could make subtle changes to or tweak, in response to what shelf-life investigations might reveal. With the intended supply chain in mind, and the base formulation in place, shelf-life trials can commence. Of course, the best way to approach this is to simulate shelf-life, and indeed this is the most obvious, simplest and the one which would yield the most precise results. However, in the case of long shelf-life products, and we’re talking about products with a shelf-life as long as one or two years here, the conduct of a shelf-life trial for two years may be impractical. Under such circumstances, accelerated shelf-life trials or predictive modelling can be undertaken, and there are various research papers in the scientific literature describing mathematical modelling of the growth of various microorganisms from a spoilage or safety consideration.To know where to start extending shelf-life, it is important to know some basic facts – such as the current shelf-life, the preservation approaches currently employed, what limits shelf-life, length of the current and anticipated supply chain and the expected environmental conditions experienced, along with the microbiological quality of the raw materials and the processing environment. This information, coupled with an understanding of the typical spoilage or pathogenic microorganisms associated with that food, will give an excellent indication as to how shelf-life can be extended. There are many ways to extend shelf-life – chemical preservatives, traditional processes such as heat and a myriad of new and emerging non-thermal methods of food preservation, among others. Some are better suited to certain food types, certain microorganisms or may have other constraints related to the supply chain or economic considerations.","food microbiology, food product development, food science, food spoilage, product development"
Fungi,"eukaryotic-microbiology, food-quality, fungi, yeast","Yeasts and food spoilage: Part 1, Overall importance and general characteristics.",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/yeasts-and-food-spoilage-part-1-overall-importance-and-general-characteristics/,"January 5, 2020","By: Doreen Ting and Philip ButtonOriginally written by Ms Doreen Ting in 2008, with guidance from Dr Philip Button.  Current update and partial rewrite by Dr Philip Button.Food serves as a source of nutrition for humans and animals. However, it also serves as a substrate for the growth of microorganisms. The growth of microorganisms can be beneficial (for example, during production of fermented foods) as well as non-beneficial (growth in food leading to spoilage). Yeast (unicellular fungi) are undoubtedly the most important group of microorganisms exploited for commercial purposes, in particular bread making and the production of alcoholic beverages (Deak & Beuchat, 1996). To give an indication of the economic importance of wine to the Australian, data from Wine Australia (2019) show 63% of Australian wine is exported to a total value of $2.8 billion.  However, yeast has also been a major concern in the food industry in terms of their ability to alter the quality of food products, hence impacting shelf life. The undesirable growth of yeast in some food products causes significant economic losses to the food industry. Deak & Beuchat (1996) state that yeast in general, are capable of growing in a wide range of foods under very specific environmental conditions, and under such conditions, metabolic activities of yeast may result in extensive economic losses to the food industry.  Such conditions include 65-70% (w/w) sucrose, where the extremely low water activity results in very limited competition (Tokuoka, 1993).  Spoilage of food products by yeast is detectable through odour or taste, in addition to physical changes. Therefore, in hopes of finding the best control method for these spoilage yeasts, one approach is adopting a “hurdle technology” concept such as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, which will be detailed in a subsequent part in this series.Yeast are certainly of special interest to food microbiologists due to the significant economical losses they cause to the food and beverage industry.  This is especially so because they are able to grow in a wide range of food; high (syrups) to low (beverages) viscosity food, high sugar to high salt content food, and solid food such as fruits.  These yeasts are characterised by their ability to not only survive, but thrive in environments hostile to many other microorganisms (Makdesi & Beuchat, 1996).  While osmotolerance is generally recognised across this genus (El Halouat  & Debevere, 1996), Malfeito-Ferreira (2019) says thatZ. rouxiiis recognised for its high-level osmotolerance whileZ. bailiihas a reputation for resistance to multiple normally lethal conditions, such as low pH, high organic acid concentration, preservatives and it also possess high osmotolerance.  Its ability to tolerate stress conditions is of major concern to the food industry, and in fact Malfeito-Ferreira (2019) states that members of theZygosaccharomycesgenus are amongst the most “feared” spoilage organisms amongst manufacturers of high sugar and high acid products.Z. bailii(Figure 1) in particular, is recognised as “the most preservative-resistant organism known” (Stratford & Capell, 2003).  Not only that, but stress cross protection has been observed in this species where exposure to a given preservative confers resistance to other preservative agents (Stratfordet al., 2013).  Furthermore, the fructose fermentation preference (typically producing acid and gas) ofZ.bailiiis a less common characteristic that can be exploited in its isolation from spoiled foods (Smittle & Flowers, 1982). These are major yeast contaminants, spoiling foods and beverages such as pickles, dried fruits (Verma & Joshi, 2000; Deak & Beuchat, 1996), mayonnaise (Kurtzmanet al., 1971), fruit concentrates (Thomas & Davenport, 1985), soft drinks (Thomas & Davenport, 1985) and red wine (Malfeito-Ferreira, 2019).Figure 1:Zygosaccharomyces bailiiImage source: M. Stratford, C.J. Capell, inEncyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition (Second Edition), 2003Yeast have created undesirable properties in food products including off flavours and haze (Rodrigues et al., 2001) along with excessive carbon dioxide production (Zuehlke, 2003).Z. bailiiis known to metabolise much aggressively compared to the other two species,Z. rouxiiandZ. bisporus. This not only has caused spoilage of food but also has lead to explosion of canned and bottled foods and beverages on the shelf (Levya et al., 1999; Oda et al., 2006).ReferencesDeak, T & Beuchat, LR (1996).

History,"commentry, food-safety, history",The rule of microorganisms,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-rule-of-microorganisms/,"February 2, 2020","We are in a state of society or human civilisation where we are advancing faster than ever before – our creativity, our innovation and our progress seem to be boundless and what wasn’t even a thought not long ago is well on the to becoming reality (Figure 1).Figure 1: Human progress over the last 200 years.Take the last 50 years, back to 1970.  The difference in so many facets of the world is so vastly different between 1970 and 2020.  The same can’t be said for the progress made between 1870 and 1920, let alone say between 1370 an 1420.  With new fields of study and new professions rapidly emerging, society is advancing at an unprecedented rate.  Driverless cars, drones, artificial intelligence and 5G are revolutionising our world.  Despite these seemingly boundless gains in so many areas of human endeavour, we are in the midst of yet another disease pandemic.  Not “just another” pandemic, but a global pandemic (Figure 2), a global pandemic so serious that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared the current coronavirus pandemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) (Figure 3).Figure 2: Global cases of the 2019-nCoV virus as of at 08:00 UTC on 1 February 2020.Figure 3: The 2019-nCoV global pandemic is a Public Health Emergency of International ConcernAs a global community, humankind can achieve so much and conquer nearly anything, it seems.  However, we are brought to our knees by a virus of just 100 nm in size, which converts to 0.0001 mm, which is unimaginably small.Figure 4: Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the 2019-nCoV virus.A virus, which like all viruses, lacks the ability to grow and replicate outside of a host cell – they hijack, if you like, the metabolic machinery of their host cell, which thus changes from maintaining and growing the host cell to simply growing and replicating new virus particles, or virions as they are called (Figure 5).Figure 5: The life of viruses.This all means viruses are not considered living and thus they are not considered lifeforms, because they don’t fulfil the basic criteria of life (Figure 6).  So, get your head around this, an entity that doesn’t fulfil the criteria to be called a form of life is striking fear into humanity, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality and crippling the economy, quite possibly the global economy.Figure 6: Requirements for life.As of 31 January 2020, Sarah Knapton reports in the Telegraph (1) that epidemiological modelling by The University of Hong Kong say around 75 000 people are estimated to be infected in Wuhan alone, with the size of the pandemic doubling every six days.  As of yesterday, 259 people are believed to have died from the infection with nearly 12 000 infected, officially, report Yeung and George on CNN (2).  The interesting aspect to consider, and what I really want to point out here is that disease epidemics and even global pandemics have been occurring for centuries (Figure 7).Figure 7: Just a handful of the epidemics and pandemics of the world.While the significance of the eradication of smallpox cannot be understated, especially considering that an estimated 500 million died from it between 1877 and the last known case in 1977, it seems that there are always diseases out there almost waiting to take the place of those which diminish in number of cases, or are eradicated, in the case of smallpox.  Like Spanish Flu, caused by an H1N1 influenza virus, killed between an estimated 50 000 000 and 100 000 000 between 1918 and 1920 or what is probably the most famous epidemic in history, the Black Death, caused byYersinia pestis, which killed an estimated 75 000 000 to 200 000 000 people between 1331 and 1353.  Even with recent foodborne diseases, there are still “records” being broken.  For example, theListeria monocytogenesoutbreak of 2017 and 2018 in South Africa was the largest in history, anywhere in the world, with 1 060 infected and 216 deaths.  Even cholera outbreaks continue to occur, and have been occurring for hundreds of years – the most recent and still ongoing is in Yemen where close to 4 000 people have died and around 1 200 000 cases reported since 2016.  Figure 8 shows the impact as of October 2017.Figure 8: Status of cholera in Yemen as of October 2017.Bacteria, or microorganisms that are not even living (viruses) have decimated humanity over millennia, and continue to do so.  All this, while we can do more in the current age than ever before, we are the most advanced, have made the most progress and an unprecedented rate is recent times, yet, infectious diseases still kill, and kill in such significance.  Why is it that non-living entities can have such sustained and significant impacts over the the most “superior” of all lifeforms, such an impact that humankind cannot conquer, as wave after wave of infectious diseases sweep the planet.  No doubt an interesting point to ponder.  Does that make microbiology the most important of all human endeavours?  Does that make microbiology worthy of increased attention?  Does that make microbiology worthy of increased resources?  If one wants to save the world, then the microbial world is a good place to start, and dare I say it, to end – such is the significance of microbiology to society and humankind, that maybe most (is it too bold to say all?) the problems of the world can be addressed and solved through microbiology.   So yes, who rules the world? People or microorganisms?  I’ll leave you with that thought.Referenceshttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/01/31/coronavirus-75000-people-infected-wuhan-experts-now-believe/https://edition.cnn.com/asia/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-02-01-20-intl-hnk/index.html","coronaviridae, coronavirus, epidemic, food microbiology, microbiology, pandemic, pheic, virology"
Immunity,"fermented-foods, immunity, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",The Role of Fermented Foods in Enhancing Immunity: Insights from Recent Studies,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-role-of-fermented-foods-in-enhancing-immunity-insights-from-recent-studies/,"May 9, 2024","By: Zixian Zhao – Cancer immunologistat Food Microbiology AcademyIn the realm of nutritional science, the connection between diet and immune health has been extensively explored, revealing complex interactions that influence overall health. Recent studies have particularly highlighted the role of fermented foods in modulating the immune system, offering promising avenues for enhancing immune responses and managing various health conditions. This blog article delves into the findings from recent research to unpack how fermented foods can be pivotal in boosting immunity.Understanding Immunity and NutritionOur immune system, a sophisticated network of cells and proteins, serves as the body’s defence against infections. The critical role of nutrition in supporting immune function is well-documented, highlighting that proper nutrients are essential for robust immune health and disease prevention. Unlike simple probiotic supplements, fermented foods sometimes contain live cultures that can function as probiotics,  often bacteria and sometimes yeasts that are integral to gut health—a major player in immunological well-being.  Furthermore, the fermentation process results in a myriad of metabolic compounds, many of which are of much benefit to human health.Key Findings from Recent ResearchNutritional Control of Immunity: The interaction between diet and immune cell functionality is intricate. According to Veronica De Rosa and her team, dietary components profoundly influence the equilibrium between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes, thus impacting health outcomes significantly (De Rosa et al., 2015).Nutritional Immunology: Fleur Ponton and colleagues discuss the multifaceted relationship between malnutrition—both under-nutrition and over-nutrition—and immune impairment, which heightens disease vulnerability (Ponton et al., 2011).Fermented Foods and Immune Modulation: Upasana Sarma and Suchandra Gupta’s research on Indian ethnic fermented foods illustrates how microbial activity in these foods not only fills nutritional voids but also enhances immunity across various populations (Sarma & Gupta, 2022).Clinical Implications for Cancer Patients: In a pivotal study, Nan Lin et al. found that fermented vegetables could alleviate adverse effects in esophageal cancer patients undergoing combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy, by bolstering nutritional and immunological parameters (Lin et al., 2022).Fermented Foods in Experimental Models: Investigations into Xeniji, a fermented food product, have demonstrated its potential to bolster antioxidant levels and immune responses in mice, highlighting the health-supportive properties of fermented foods (Zulkawi et al., 2017), at least in a mouse model.The Science Behind Fermented Foods and ImmunityFermented foods enhance immunity primarily through their impact on gut health. The fermentation process increases the bioavailability of nutrients, which can better support immune functions. Additionally, the microorganisms that are sometimes present in fermented foods help balance the gut microbiome, a critical element for a healthy immune system. By improving gut health, fermented foods indirectly enhance immune responses and reduce inflammation.Practical ApplicationsIncorporating fermented foods into the diet can be a strategic approach to improve immune health. Examples include:Yogurt and Kefir: Rich in lactobacilli, these foods can enhance gut flora and immune function.Kimchi and Sauerkraut: These fermented vegetables are high in vitamins that can help boost the immune system.Expanding on Fermented Foods and Immune HealthGlobally, fermented foods are integral to many traditional diets and are prized for their distinct flavours and health-promoting properties, especially in enhancing immune health. These foods boost immunity largely by improving gut health. The fermentation process enriches the availability of nutrients, thereby supporting the immune system more effectively. Although fermentation does not generate probiotics, it cultivates conditions that encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria, including probiotics, provided they are part of the initial ingredients. By promoting a balanced gut microbiome, fermented foods indirectly bolster immune function and mitigate inflammation.Future Research Directions in Fermented Foods and ImmunityFuture research on fermented foods and immune health should focus on identifying specific probiotic strains with the highest therapeutic potential, understanding the mechanisms through which these foods influence immune cells via the gut microbiota, and assessing the long-term health impacts of their regular consumption. Studies could also explore the role of fermented foods in managing non-communicable diseases through immune modulation and develop personalised nutrition strategies based on individual microbiome differences. This targeted research could lead to more precise dietary recommendations and innovative health solutions.ConclusionThe intersection of nutrition and immune health is a critical area of study, particularly in the context of increasing health issues related to poor dietary choices. Fermented foods, especially those with a rich probiotic content have health-enhancing properties, and offer a valuable tool for improving immune health. As research continues to unfold, it becomes clear that integrating fermented foods into daily dietary practices can be a beneficial strategy for maintaining health and preventing disease.In conclusion, while more clinical trials and research are needed to fully understand the optimal types and quantities of fermented foods for health benefits, the current evidence strongly supports their role in promoting a healthy immune system and overall health. Incorporating these foods into a balanced diet, alongside other healthful practices, could potentially lead to better health outcomes and a stronger immune systemReferencesDe Rosa, V., Galgani, M., Santopaolo, M., Colamatteo, A., Laccetti, R., & Matarese, G.

Immunity,"immunity, prebiotics",Why you should include prebiotics in your diet?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/why-you-should-include-prebiotics-in-your-diet/,"June 3, 2021","Though the benefits of probiotics have been studied for almost a century, only recently have their use skyrocketed, partly owing to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Even if you are not currently consuming probiotics, chances are the thought might have crossed your mind at least once. After all, the current health food buzzword is probiotics, and so many people seem to be consuming them. Be it the ever-simple yogurt or drinks like Yakult or even probiotic capsules, the benefits advertised are many-fold, and one should incorporate them in some form in their diet, especially if experiencing gut health issues (Fig 1).Fig 1: Health benefits of probioticsHowever, as you begin a journey on improving your gut health, focusing on bothprebioticsand probiotics can have compounded benefits when compared to your probiotic regimen alone. Well, what are prebiotics and what do they do?Fig 2: Foods rich in prebiotic fibresPrebiotics are defined as fermented short chain oligosaccharides, or fibres, that enhance the activity of our intestinal micro-flora. Simply put, prebiotics are “good food” for your intestinal bacteria and help them to produce functional metabolites, that improve our bodily health. To be functional, a prebiotic must be resistant to colonic digestion by the host while undergoing fermentation by the intestinal microbiota. Applying this definition, there are several digestive fibers which can be utilised as prebiotics. Generally, these include resistant starch, fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and several non-starch polysaccharides. These undergo fermentation and ultimately get released as short chain fatty acids or SCFAs, which aid in several physiological functions of our body.Now that we know their benefit, one can obtain their prebiotics naturally, from several foods, including chicory root, artichokes, garlic, onion, and cereals such as wheat, barley and millet (Fig 2). If you already have a diet rich in fiber, you can start adding probiotic foods, and vice versa if you already consume probiotics. Either way, it is imperative to modify your diet to add more fiber to have a healthy gut. You will have small issues like bloating, flatulence, or other disorders when you practice a poor diet  – constituting less fibre intake – and if continued long term, it can become chronic and may even lead to inflammatory diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colitis, persistent diarrhea and other gastrointestinal conditions.BENEFITSFig 3: Mechanism of action of probiotics and prebioticsIt has been demonstrated that our gut is connected to our brain through a network of millions of neurons, and bidirectional signals between the brain and our gut through the vagus nerve can alter the GI tract’s sensory and motor function whilst impacting our brain functions too. Our enteric nervous system (ENS) regulates our gut function through peristalsis, absorption, and secretion, while our autonomic nervous system (ANS) does the same using the central nervous system (CNS), by controlling digestion, bile secretion, mucus levels and more. As mentioned earlier, SCFAs produced from the fermentation of prebiotics are absorbed into our blood circulation, and reach various tissues, including our brain where they play a pivotal role in regulating our neurological functions. Several mice model studies have confirmed that the SCFAs play a role in ENS homeostasis, stress alleviation, and promote regularity of our neural systems (Everard et al, 2011; Savignac et al, 2015; Burokas et al, 2017). Additionally, some prebiotics are known to increase our native gut microbiome proliferation, promote anti-inflammation, and reducing anxiety-like behaviors signaling a direct effect on our brain function trough the gut-brain axis. However, it’s not just the nervous system that is the point of action for the prebiotics. As you build up your fiber intake, the accretion of the chewing time in the oral cavity can promote saliva and gastric acid production, which also contributes towards higher satiety (Parnell et al, 2006). This also affects our insulin, and ghrelin (hunger hormones) secretions, eventually regulating our food intake and promoting satiation (van der beek et al, 2018). However, the most interesting claim for prebiotic intake is the supposed health implications on our gut immunity. One may be confused about the term “gut immunity”, and rightly so. Though it is well known that our immune system is composed of several barriers, our gut encounters the majority of antigens, and any immunogenic compromise can have adverse health effects almost immediately. So, it is no surprise that the major player in our immune system is located in our gastrointestinal tract – gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). GALT induces immune reaction by activating T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells in response to pathogenic entry and prebiotics can enhance our GALT’s action. SCFAs are known to reduce the occurrence of colon cancer, colitis, and may also inhibit colonization of pathogenic bacteria to our epithelial lining through anti-inflammatory pathways (Komiyama et al, 2011; Rivera-Huerta et al, 2017; Rani et al, 2019). Among other functions, SCFAs also act as signaling factors and increase the production of regulatory T cells, improving our gut immunity (Freitas et al, 2014). SCFAs produced by our gut microbiome also increase calcium bioavailability, thereby increasing our bone density and improving iron absorption. Epidemiological research has also suggested a link between a low prebiotic diet and cardiovascular diseases (Kochar et al, 2007; Tang et al, 2019). SCFAs alter lipid metabolism, and possibly lower your risk for heart diseases, by reducing the LDL cholesterol serum concentrations. Overall, the promising benefits of prebiotics promote them as a powerful tool for altering your microbial composition and to strengthen your immunity.REFERENCESBurokas, Aurelijus, Arboleya, Silvia, Moloney, Rachel D, Peterson, Veronica L, Murphy, Kiera, Clarke, Gerard, Stanton, Catherine, Dinan, Timothy G, & Cryan, John F.

Prebiotics,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Probiotics in gut health and immunity,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/probiotics-in-gut-health-and-immunity/,"April 3, 2024","Probiotics, often hailed as the guardians of gut health, have taken centre stage in the narrative of nutritional science and wellness. Their role extends beyond mere digestion aid, intertwining with the intricate workings of the immune system. This blog post delves into the multifaceted influence of probiotics on gut health and immunity, uncovering the science behind their beneficial effects.Probiotics explainedProbiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. These beneficial bacteria and yeasts are predominantly found in fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and kombucha, or as dietary supplements. They are known to enhance gut flora, or the microbiome, which is a complex community of microorganisms living in our intestines...The gut microbiome: A central player in healthThe gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the body’s overall health, affecting everything from digestion and nutrient absorption to immune function and even mental health. A balanced gut microbiome helps to break down food, synthesise vitamins, and protect against pathogens. Probiotics contribute to this balance, adding to the diversity and functionality of the gut’s microbial community.Probiotics and gut healthThe relationship between probiotics and gut health is symbiotic. Probiotics aid in maintaining a healthy intestinal environment by:Enhancing the intestinal barrier: They strengthen the gut lining, preventing harmful substances and pathogens from leaking into the body.Balancing the microbiome: Probiotics help restore and maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, especially after disruptions caused by antibiotics, poor diet, or illness.Supporting digestion and nutrient absorption: They assist in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients, which is crucial for overall health.Immunity boost through gut healthA significant portion of the immune system resides in the gut, making gut health and immunity deeply interconnected. Probiotics influence the immune system by:Regulating immune responses: Probiotics can modulate the immune system, enhancing its ability to fight off infections while also preventing excessive inflammation, often associated with autoimmune diseases.Producing antimicrobial substances: Some probiotics produce substances that have antimicrobial properties, which can directly combat pathogenic bacteria.Enhancing mucosal immunity: Probiotics stimulate the activity of mucosal immune cells, boosting the body’s first line of defense against pathogens.Probiotics in disease prevention and managementResearch suggests that probiotics can play a role in preventing and managing various health conditions, particularly those related to gut health and immune function, such as:Gastrointestinal disorders: Probiotics are beneficial in managing conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and infectious diarrhea.Immune-related conditions: Regular intake of probiotics has been linked to reduced severity and frequency of respiratory infections, allergies, and certain autoimmune disorders.Mental health: Emerging evidence supports the role of probiotics in improving mood and cognitive function, shedding light on the gut-brain axis.Choosing the right probioticsThe probiotic world is diverse, with different strains offering specific health benefits. The efficacy of probiotics depends on the strain, dosage, and individual health conditions. For example,Lactobacillus rhamnosusGG andSaccharomyces boulardiihave been extensively studied for their positive effects on gastrointestinal health..Incorporating probiotics into the dietTo reap the benefits of probiotics, incorporating them into the daily diet is key. Fermented foods naturally rich in probiotics and high-quality supplements can be excellent sources. However, it’s crucial to ensure that these products contain live and active cultures and to consider the specific strains and quantities needed to achieve desired health effects.Future perspectivesThe field of probiotics is expanding, with ongoing research exploring their potential in treating and preventing a broader range of health issues. Personalised probiotics and the role of prebiotics (fibres that feed beneficial bacteria) are areas of growing interest, promising more targeted and effective interventions for individual health needs.ConclusionIn conclusion, probiotics play a pivotal role in promoting gut health and strengthening immunity.

Prebiotics,"bacteria, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Unraveling the gut health puzzle: Why prebiotics are more important than probiotics,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/unraveling-the-gut-health-puzzle-why-prebiotics-are-more-important-than-probiotics/,"October 29, 2023","The world of gut health has been abuzz with the terms “probiotics” and “prebiotics.” These words have become synonymous with digestive well-being, but what’s often overlooked is the vital role prebiotics play in maintaining a healthy gut. While probiotics undoubtedly offer benefits, it’s increasingly clear that prebiotics, the unsung heroes, may be even more important in promoting a balanced and thriving gut microbiome. In this article, we’ll explore why prebiotics should take center stage in your quest for digestive health.Defining the terms: Probiotics vs. prebioticsBefore delving into their respective roles, let’s clarify what probiotics and prebiotics are:Probioticsare live beneficial microorganisms, primarily bacteria and some yeasts, that can enhance the gut’s microbial balance when consumed. Common sources include yogurt, kefir, and dietary supplements.Prebiotics, on the other hand, are non-digestible fibers or compounds that serve as nourishment for beneficial gut bacteria, helping them grow and thrive. They are found in various foods, such as onions, garlic, and certain whole grains.The gut microbiome: A complex ecosystemThe human gut is a bustling ecosystem comprising trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiome. This microbial community plays a crucial role in digestion, immune function, and even mental health. A balanced gut microbiome contributes to overall well-being.Why probiotics are importantProbiotics have garnered significant attention and research due to their potential to introduce beneficial microorganisms into the gut. They can help restore microbial balance, support digestion, and offer some potential health benefits. However, probiotics have limitations:Transient nature: Probiotics are transient visitors. They don’t permanently establish themselves in the gut. To maintain their benefits, you must consistently consume probiotic-rich foods or supplements.Variability: The effectiveness of probiotics varies between individuals. Factors such as the type of probiotic strain, dosage, and individual gut conditions can impact their success.Survival challenges: Probiotic microorganisms can face challenges in surviving stomach acid and reaching the intestines in sufficient numbers to be effective.Limited impact: While probiotics can provide relief for some digestive conditions, their impact is often modest compared to the role of prebiotics in nurturing existing beneficial bacteria.The prebiotic advantagePrebiotics, in contrast, offer a more sustainable and profound impact on gut health:Selective nourishment: Prebiotics serve as a specific food source for beneficial gut bacteria. This nourishment encourages the growth and activity of these microbes, contributing to a balanced gut microbiome.Diversity and resilience: Prebiotics support the growth of a wide range of beneficial bacteria. A diverse gut microbiome is more resilient to disturbances and better equipped to perform essential functions.Long-lasting effects: Unlike probiotics, prebiotics have a lasting impact on gut health. They promote the growth of native, beneficial microbes that can continue to thrive and function effectively over time.Improved digestion and health: Prebiotics can enhance the absorption of nutrients, support bowel regularity, and strengthen the gut’s protective barrier. They are linked to improved digestion and a reduced risk of certain health conditions.Finding prebiotics in your dietPrebiotics can be readily incorporated into your daily diet through various food sources, including:Fruits: Bananas, apples, and citrus fruits are rich in prebiotic fibers.Vegetables: Garlic, onions, leeks, and asparagus are excellent sources.Whole grains: Oats, barley, and whole wheat contain prebiotic compounds.Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, and black beans are good choices.Nuts and seeds: Almonds and flaxseeds provide prebiotic benefits.Inulin supplements: Inulin is a type of prebiotic fibre available in supplement form.A holistic approach to gut healthWhile probiotics can be valuable in specific situations, they should complement, rather than replace, a diet rich in prebiotic-rich foods. A holistic approach to gut health includes both elements, with prebiotics serving as the foundation for nurturing your gut microbiome.By prioritising prebiotics in your diet, you empower your body to support its natural, beneficial microorganisms, creating an environment where they can thrive. This approach contributes to a resilient, diverse, and balanced gut microbiome that, in turn, supports overall health and well-being.In conclusion, the world of gut health should focus on the prebiotic side of the equation. While probiotics have their merits, prebiotics offer long-lasting, selective nourishment that can foster a thriving, resilient gut microbiome. Make prebiotic-rich foods a staple in your diet, and you’ll be taking a significant step toward digestive well-being and overall health.","food microbiology, food science, gut health, probiotics"
Prebiotics,"bacteria, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Delving into prebiotics and how they benefit our health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/delving-into-prebiotics-and-how-they-benefit-our-health/,"May 8, 2023","Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers or carbohydrates that serve as food for the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. They are typically found in plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Prebiotics cannot be broken down by the human digestive system, so they pass through the stomach and small intestine undigested and reach the colon intact.Once in the colon, prebiotics are fermented by the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. This fermentation process produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are the main source of energy for the cells lining the colon. SCFAs also play an important role in maintaining gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria.Prebiotics are beneficial to our health in many ways. They have been shown to improve digestive health, boost immunity, lower inflammation, and improve metabolic health. They also help to maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut microbiota, which is important for overall health and wellbeing.Examples of prebiotics include inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS), and resistant starch. These compounds are found in foods like bananas, onions, garlic, asparagus, oats, and legumes. To maximize the prebiotic content of your diet, it’s important to consume a variety of fiber-rich plant-based foods.Inulin is a type of prebiotic dietary fiber that is found in a variety of plant-based foods. It is a complex carbohydrate that is made up of chains of fructose molecules, and it is resistant to digestion in the human small intestine. Inulin is fermented by the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that provide energy to the cells lining the colon and promote gut health.Inulin is commonly extracted from plants like chicory root, Jerusalem artichoke, and agave. It is used as an ingredient in a variety of food products, including yogurts, bars, cereals, and baked goods, as well as dietary supplements. Inulin is often added to foods to increase their fiber content and improve their nutritional profile.Research has shown that consuming inulin may have several health benefits, including improving digestive health, boosting immunity, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, inulin has been found to increase feelings of fullness and aid in weight management, making it a popular ingredient in weight loss products.Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are both types of prebiotic dietary fibers that serve as food for the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. However, there are some differences between the two.FOS are made up of chains of fructose molecules, while GOS are made up of chains of galactose molecules. Both FOS and GOS are resistant to digestion in the small intestine, and they are fermented by the beneficial bacteria in the colon, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that provide energy to the cells lining the colon and promote gut health.FOS are commonly found in foods like chicory root, onions, garlic, and asparagus. They have a slightly sweet taste and are often used as a natural sweetener in food products. FOS have been shown to improve digestive health, boost immunity, and lower inflammation.GOS are less commonly found in food, but they can be synthesized from lactose, which is found in milk. GOS are often added to infant formula to mimic the prebiotic effects of human milk. GOS have been shown to improve gut health and reduce the risk of infections in infants.Overall, FOS and GOS are similar in their prebiotic effects and health benefits, but they have different chemical structures and sources. Both can be beneficial to consume as part of a healthy diet.Prebiotic resistant starch is a type of dietary fiber that is resistant to digestion in the small intestine and serves as food for the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. Resistant starch is a form of starch that is not broken down by digestive enzymes in the small intestine and instead reaches the colon intact, where it is fermented by the gut microbiota.Resistant starch is found in foods like legumes, whole grains, green bananas, and potatoes that have been cooked and then cooled. When these foods are cooked and cooled, the starch molecules undergo a process called retrogradation, which increases their resistance to digestion.Research has shown that consuming prebiotic resistant starch may have several health benefits, including improving digestive health, reducing inflammation, and lowering the risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. Prebiotic resistant starch has also been found to improve insulin sensitivity and aid in weight management by increasing feelings of fullness.It’s important to note that not all types of starch are prebiotic resistant starch. For example, highly processed foods like white bread and white rice have very little resistant starch, while whole grain bread and brown rice have higher amounts. To increase your intake of prebiotic resistant starch, it’s recommended to consume a variety of whole foods that are rich in resistant starch.","food microbiology, food science, gut health, gut microbiome, gut microflora, microbiology"
Prebiotics,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",The gut-brain connection: How gut health impacts anxiety and mental health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-gut-brain-connection-how-gut-health-impacts-anxiety-and-mental-health/,"April 16, 2023","Introduction to the gut-brain connectionThe human body is an incredibly complex system, and it’s only in recent years that we’ve begun to understand the intricate connections between our organs and systems. One of the most fascinating of these is the gut-brain connection, which refers to the bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain. This connection is the reason why gut health is crucial for mental health and why an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to anxiety and depression.What is gut health and why is it important for mental health?Gut health refers to the balance of microorganisms in the gut, which includes bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These microorganisms play a crucial role in the body’s immune system, digestion, and overall health. When the balance of microorganisms in the gut is disrupted, it can lead to a range of health problems, including mental health issues.Research has shown that the gut is often referred to as the second brain, and it’s easy to see why. The gut contains over 100 million neurons, which communicate with the brain via the vagus nerve. This communication plays a vital role in regulating mood, behavior, and cognitive function.The gut microbiome and its impact on mental healthThe gut microbiome refers to the collection of microorganisms that live in the gut. This microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health, and research has shown that it also has a significant impact on mental health. The gut microbiome communicates with the brain via the gut-brain axis, which means that an imbalance in the microbiome can have a direct impact on mental health.Studies have shown that people with depression and anxiety often have an imbalance in their gut microbiome. This imbalance can lead to inflammation, which is a known contributor to mental health issues. Additionally, an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to nutrient deficiencies, which can further contribute to mental health problems.The link between gut health and anxietyAnxiety is a common mental health disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. While the causes of anxiety are complex and varied, research has shown that gut health plays a significant role in its development. Studies have found that people with anxiety often have an imbalance in their gut microbiome, which can lead to an increase in inflammation and a decrease in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin.Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood and behavior, and an imbalance in its production can lead to anxiety and depression. Additionally, the gut microbiome is responsible for the production of GABA, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in reducing anxiety.The link between gut health and depressionDepression is another common mental health disorder that is often linked to gut health. Like anxiety, depression is a complex condition with numerous contributing factors. However, research has shown that an imbalance in the gut microbiome can play a significant role in its development.Studies have found that people with depression often have a lower diversity of gut bacteria, which can lead to inflammation and a decrease in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. Additionally, an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to an increase in the production of stress hormones such as cortisol, which can further contribute to depression.The role of diet in gut health and mental healthDiet plays a vital role in maintaining gut health and can have a significant impact on mental health. A diet that is high in processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats can lead to an imbalance in the gut microbiome and an increase in inflammation. On the other hand, a diet that is rich in whole foods, fiber, and healthy fats can help to promote a healthy gut microbiome and reduce inflammation.Gut-friendly foods to improve mental healthThe following foods are excellent for promoting gut health and improving mental health:Fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, and kimchi, which are rich in probioticsPrebiotic foods such as garlic, onions, and asparagus, which help to feed the good bacteria in the gutFiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which help to promote a healthy gut microbiomeOmega-3 rich foods such as fatty fish, nuts, and seeds, which can help to reduce inflammation and promote healthy brain functionProbiotics and their impact on mental healthProbiotics are live microorganisms that can help to promote a healthy gut microbiome. Studies have shown that taking probiotics can help to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Additionally, probiotics can help to reduce inflammation, which is a known contributor to mental health issues.Lifestyle changes to improve gut health and mental healthIn addition to diet and probiotics, there are several lifestyle changes that people can make to promote gut health and improve mental health. These include:Reducing stress through practices such as meditation, yoga, and deep breathingGetting regular exercise, which can help to reduce inflammation and promote a healthy gut microbiomeGetting enough sleep, which is crucial for both gut health and mental healthAvoiding antibiotics unless absolutely necessary, as they can disrupt the gut microbiomeAvoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, which can disrupt gut healthConclusion: Taking care of your gut for better mental healthIn conclusion, the gut-brain connection is a fascinating and complex system that plays a crucial role in mental health. Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle changes can help to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression and promote better overall mental health. By taking care of your gut, you can take care of your mind.  If you’re struggling with anxiety or depression, take a look at your gut health. Making changes to your diet and lifestyle can have a significant impact on your mental health. Additionally, consider taking a probiotic supplement to help promote a healthy gut microbiome. Remember, taking care of your gut is crucial for taking care of your mind.","anxiety, depression, food microbiology, gut health, gut microbiome, gut microflora, gut-brain axis, mental health, probiotics"
Prebiotics,prebiotics,Hemp and it’s prebiotic role,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/hemp-and-its-prebiotic-role/,"March 6, 2023","Hemp is a variety of theCannabis sativaplant species that is grown specifically for industrial use.  It is known for its strong fibers, which are used to make products such as rope, clothing, and paper, as well as its seeds, which are a source of food and oil.  Hemp contains very low levels of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive compound that causes a “high.” By law, hemp plants must contain less than 0.3% THC content on a dry weight basis in order to be considered hemp, rather than marijuana.This low level of THC in hemp makes it unlikely to produce any psychoactive effects when consumed, even in large quantities. However, it is important to note that some hemp-derived products, such as full-spectrum hemp extract, may contain trace amounts of THC and may cause a positive drug test result.It is a versatile plant that offers many potential benefits, including:Nutritional value: Hemp seeds are a good source of protein, healthy fats, fiber, and a range of vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, potassium, and iron.Environmentally friendly: Hemp is a highly sustainable crop that requires very little water and pesticides, and has the potential to improve soil health.Industrial uses: Hemp fibers can be used to make a wide range of products, including paper, clothing, and building materials, and can be a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional materials.Health benefits: Hemp seeds and oil have been shown to have potential health benefits, including improving heart health, reducing inflammation, and reducing symptoms of certain skin conditions.Legalization: The legalization of hemp in many countries has created new opportunities for research, development, and commercialization of hemp-based products.Hemp is considered a good source of prebiotics because it contains high amounts of soluble fiber, particularly beta-glucans, which serve as food for the beneficial bacteria in the gut. This type of fiber is not digested by the human body, but instead ferments in the gut, providing fuel for the growth and activity of the gut microbiome.Studies have shown that hemp seeds and their derived products, such as hemp flour, hemp protein, and hemp oil, contain prebiotic fiber that can help to improve gut health, boost immunity, and support digestive function. Additionally, hemp seeds are a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and may help to reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases.In conclusion, hemp is a good source of prebiotics because of its high fiber content, which provides nourishment for the gut microbiome, and its potential health benefits, such as improved gut health, enhanced immune function, and reduced inflammation.Beta-glucans are complex sugars (polysaccharides) found in the cell walls of certain plants, fungi, and bacteria. They are best known for their health benefits, particularly in the area of immune function.In the human body, beta-glucans are recognised as foreign substances by immune cells and stimulate an immune response. This immune activation can help to improve the body’s ability to fight off infections, reduce inflammation, and lower the risk of certain chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer.Beta-glucans are commonly found in foods such as whole grains, mushrooms, and some types of seaweed. They are also available as dietary supplements. It is important to note that not all beta-glucans have the same effects, as the structure and type of beta-glucan can impact its biological activity.The specific type of hemp product with the highest amount of beta-glucans will depend on various factors such as the strain of hemp and the part of the plant that is used.In general, whole hemp seeds and their derived products, such as hemp flour and hemp protein, are considered good sources of beta-glucans. In these products, the beta-glucans are found in the seed coat and the pericarp, which are the outer layers of the seed.Hemp oil, on the other hand, is typically low in beta-glucans as they are removed during the oil extraction process.It is also important to note that the beta-glucan content of hemp products can vary greatly depending on the processing methods and conditions used, as well as other factors such as the growing conditions and maturity of the plant.In conclusion, whole hemp seeds and their derived products, such as hemp flour and hemp protein, are the types of hemp products that are likely to have the highest levels of beta-glucans. However, the actual content of beta-glucans can vary greatly and should be confirmed through lab analysis or product labeling.The amount of beta-glucan in hemp milk can vary greatly depending on the brand and formulation. Some hemp milks may contain only trace amounts of beta-glucan, while others may contain higher levels.The beta-glucan content of hemp milk is influenced by several factors, including the type of hemp used, the processing methods, and the other ingredients added to the milk. For example, some brands may use whole hemp seeds, which are a good source of beta-glucan, while others may use hemp protein isolate, which may have a lower beta-glucan content.It is best to check the label or contact the manufacturer to determine the exact beta-glucan content of a specific brand of hemp milk. In general, however, it is safe to say that hemp milk is a source of beta-glucan and can be a good way to increase your intake of this beneficial soluble fiber.","beta glucan, cannabis, food microbiology, food science, hemp"
Prebiotics,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Prebiotics and your gut microflora,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prebiotics-and-your-gut-microflora/,"February 10, 2023","The gut microflora is a diverse community of microorganisms that live in the gastrointestinal tract. It is composed of a variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms. The most prevalent and well-studied bacteria in the gut microflora are from the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.Examples of bacteria in the gut microflora include:Bifidobacterium: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut and is thought to have a number of health benefits, including improved digestion, a stronger immune system, and a reduced risk of certain diseases.Lactobacillus: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in fermented foods such as yogurt and kefir, and is also used as a probiotic supplement.Escherichia coli(E. coli): a type of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut and is important for maintaining a healthy gut microflora. Some strains ofE. coliare beneficial, while others can cause infections.Clostridium: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut, and is important for the digestion of carbohydrates.Bacteroides: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut, and is important for breaking down complex carbohydrates and proteins.It’s important to note that the gut microflora is a complex ecosystem and the number and type of bacteria present can vary greatly depending on factors such as diet, age, genetics, and overall health.Probiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed. The concept of using live microorganisms to promote health dates back to the early 20th century, when the Russian scientist Elie Metchnikoff observed that certain rural populations had longer lifespans and less incidence of disease than urban populations. He attributed this to their consumption of fermented dairy products, which he believed contained beneficial microorganisms. In the decades that followed, researchers began to isolate and study specific strains of microorganisms that they believed to have health benefits, leading to the development of probiotic supplements and products. Today, probiotics are available in a wide variety of forms, including capsules, tablets, powders, and fermented foods.Prebiotics are non-digestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the gut. They act as food for probiotics, helping to increase their numbers and improve their function.Examples of prebiotics include:Inulin: a type of fructan found in many fruits and vegetables, including onions, garlic, leeks, and asparagus.Oligosaccharides: a group of carbohydrates that includes fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). These can be found in a variety of foods, such as chicory root, Jerusalem artichokes, and soybeans.Resistant starches: a type of starch that is not broken down and absorbed in the small intestine, but instead reaches the large intestine where it can be fermented by gut bacteria. Examples include potatoes, green bananas, and legumes.Lactose: a sugar found in milk and dairy products, which is fermented by gut bacteria.Prebiotics are often added to food products such as yogurt, cereal, and energy bars, as well as supplements. They can also be found naturally in many fruits, vegetables and whole grains.Prebiotics are important for probiotic bacteria and the gut microflora because they provide a source of energy and nutrients that the beneficial microorganisms can use to grow and thrive. When prebiotics reach the large intestine, they are fermented by the gut bacteria, which produces short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate and butyrate that are essential for gut health.Prebiotics also help to promote a diverse and balanced gut microflora, which is important for maintaining gut health. A diverse gut microflora is associated with a healthy immune system, better nutrient absorption, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease.Additionally, prebiotics can improve the function of probiotics by helping to protect them from being broken down by stomach acid and bile, and also by providing an environment that supports their growth and survival.In summary, prebiotics play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy gut by providing a food source for beneficial gut bacteria, promoting diversity and balance of gut microflora, and protecting probiotic bacteria from degradation.The recommended daily intake of prebiotics varies depending on the specific type of prebiotic and the individual’s health status. However, a general guideline is to consume between 5-10 grams of prebiotics per day.It is also important to note that it is not necessary to consume prebiotics in the form of supplements, as they can be found naturally in many fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Examples of prebiotic-rich foods include:Jerusalem artichokesDandelion greensGarlicOnionsLeeksAsparagusBananas (ripe)Whole wheatBarleyOatsApplesBerriesIt is also important to note that it is best to consume a variety of prebiotic-rich foods to ensure that you are getting a diverse range of prebiotics to promote a diverse and balanced gut microflora.It is also worth noting that consuming too much prebiotics can cause digestive discomfort such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea. It’s best to start with small amounts and gradually increase the intake to see how your body reacts. Additionally, if you have any specific health conditions, it’s best to consult with a health professional before increasing your prebiotic intake.","food microbiology, food science, gut health, gut microflora, probiotics"
Prebiotics,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health","Prebiotics, probiotics and fermented foods",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prebiotics-probiotics-and-fermented-foods/,"August 27, 2022","After a four month break, we are back in the blogosphere!At some stage in the future, we plan to run a three-part webinar series on prebiotic, probiotics and fermented foods.  It’s like to be three monthly webinars, possibly over the Southern Hemisphere summer months of December, January and February.  If not the coming summer of 22/23, then quite likely the next summer of 23/24.Prebiotics, probiotics and fermented foods – they are separate and distinct, yet very much related, how so?  To get the most benefit from these three, it is essential to be clear on what they are, how they are similar, related and different.  Plus, how they relate to the other aspects of digestive or gut health as well as the gut microbiota, our microbiome altogether and indeed an appreciation, or at minimum, an acknowledgement or the wide-ranging influence the our gut health has on our overall and specific health and physiology.  While fermented foods date to antiquity, probiotics are a more recent concept, but are still certainly not new.  It really is just that they are returning to the fore, due to a heightened focus, not just on healthy eating and wellness, but on more natural approaches to maintaining a healthy homeostatic balance.  The immune system is a big topic at the moment, and our gut microbiota play a key immunomodulatory effect, in a very natural way.  How so and what can we do to maintain ourselves in top health by looking after our gut health?Well, probiotics are added ‘good’ and ‘friendly’ bacteria that are recognised, such as thorough clinical trials, to have a positive impact on the health of the person ingesting them.  Really though, probiotics could be thought of as a supplement, and shouldn’t really be necessary if you are looking after your natural and existing gut microbiome.  That’s where probiotics and fermented foods come in.  Prebiotics are really the nutrients that these gut bacteria require.  Various fibres that they thrive on, examples of which are inulin and especially the oligosaccharides known as GOS (galactic-oligosaccharides) and FOS (fructo-oligosaccharides).  These, and other prebiotic fibres, when consumed in appropriate quantities, should be able to sufficiently nourish your existing got microbiota.  This is the most natural approach, the simplest approach, and the ideal from the nutritional perspective too.  However, there might be times when your normal gut microbiome, which remember, can have an impact on various different parts of your body, might be negatively impacted by a range of circumstances.  These could include stress, a poor diet (or lifestyle overall) and/or taking of antibiotics.  Antibiotics in particular are bad news for your ‘friendly bacteria’ – once your antibiotics kill some of them off, your natural balance is disrupted and worst case scenario, the way is left open for invading pathogenic bacteria to establish.  Remember that your body constantly being challenged, whether it is by cancer cells or invading viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms.  Thus, with an out of balance gut microbial ecosystem, it’s only a matter of time that you become sick from the constant challenges of invading microorganisms.Under such circumstances, probiotics can be useful, either in foods, which may or may not be fermented, or as dietary supplements, like capsules and the like.  However, the best way to externally restore your gut microbial balance is with probiotic foods, which may or may not be fermented.  This is an important, really essential piece of understanding to gain here, which is – fermented foods are always going to be produced by microorganisms, because this is the nature of fermentation, it is a microbial process.  However, those fermented foods may or may not contain probiotics, even if the starter culture microorganisms are still present.  On the other hand, probiotic foods may or may not be fermented.  Today, there are many new and innovative probiotic food products that contain probiotics that are not fermented.  These have a range of probiotics added to them, essentially they are food additives.  A classic example is kombucha, the very popular and trending low to non-alcohol fermented beverage.  The natural fermenting starter cultures in kombucha are acetic acid bacteria.  Acetic acid bacteria do a fabulous job of fermenting sugars into acetic acid during the manufacturing process of kombucha.  While they are perfectly suited to fermentation in this context, they are not probiotic bacteria and will do nothing to improve the gut health or any other aspects of health, of the host.  Then, you might be asking, but I drink probiotic kombucha, it says probiotic on the label and it is a fermented drink.  Yes it is a fermented drink and yes it may be probiotic, but the two are unrelated.  This means that probiotics are added to kombucha.  The fermenting starter acetic acid bacteria cultures may or may not be present when you consume the drink, but it is irrelevant because they are not probiotics.We given an extremely brief overview here, but tried to convey the important consumer-related aspect of the difference and relatedness between probiotics foods/drinks and fermented foods/drinks, and how they are the same and different.","food microbiology, gut health, microbiology, probiotics"
Prebiotics,"immunity, prebiotics",Why you should include prebiotics in your diet?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/why-you-should-include-prebiotics-in-your-diet/,"June 3, 2021","Though the benefits of probiotics have been studied for almost a century, only recently have their use skyrocketed, partly owing to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Even if you are not currently consuming probiotics, chances are the thought might have crossed your mind at least once. After all, the current health food buzzword is probiotics, and so many people seem to be consuming them. Be it the ever-simple yogurt or drinks like Yakult or even probiotic capsules, the benefits advertised are many-fold, and one should incorporate them in some form in their diet, especially if experiencing gut health issues (Fig 1).Fig 1: Health benefits of probioticsHowever, as you begin a journey on improving your gut health, focusing on bothprebioticsand probiotics can have compounded benefits when compared to your probiotic regimen alone. Well, what are prebiotics and what do they do?Fig 2: Foods rich in prebiotic fibresPrebiotics are defined as fermented short chain oligosaccharides, or fibres, that enhance the activity of our intestinal micro-flora. Simply put, prebiotics are “good food” for your intestinal bacteria and help them to produce functional metabolites, that improve our bodily health. To be functional, a prebiotic must be resistant to colonic digestion by the host while undergoing fermentation by the intestinal microbiota. Applying this definition, there are several digestive fibers which can be utilised as prebiotics. Generally, these include resistant starch, fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and several non-starch polysaccharides. These undergo fermentation and ultimately get released as short chain fatty acids or SCFAs, which aid in several physiological functions of our body.Now that we know their benefit, one can obtain their prebiotics naturally, from several foods, including chicory root, artichokes, garlic, onion, and cereals such as wheat, barley and millet (Fig 2). If you already have a diet rich in fiber, you can start adding probiotic foods, and vice versa if you already consume probiotics. Either way, it is imperative to modify your diet to add more fiber to have a healthy gut. You will have small issues like bloating, flatulence, or other disorders when you practice a poor diet  – constituting less fibre intake – and if continued long term, it can become chronic and may even lead to inflammatory diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colitis, persistent diarrhea and other gastrointestinal conditions.BENEFITSFig 3: Mechanism of action of probiotics and prebioticsIt has been demonstrated that our gut is connected to our brain through a network of millions of neurons, and bidirectional signals between the brain and our gut through the vagus nerve can alter the GI tract’s sensory and motor function whilst impacting our brain functions too. Our enteric nervous system (ENS) regulates our gut function through peristalsis, absorption, and secretion, while our autonomic nervous system (ANS) does the same using the central nervous system (CNS), by controlling digestion, bile secretion, mucus levels and more. As mentioned earlier, SCFAs produced from the fermentation of prebiotics are absorbed into our blood circulation, and reach various tissues, including our brain where they play a pivotal role in regulating our neurological functions. Several mice model studies have confirmed that the SCFAs play a role in ENS homeostasis, stress alleviation, and promote regularity of our neural systems (Everard et al, 2011; Savignac et al, 2015; Burokas et al, 2017). Additionally, some prebiotics are known to increase our native gut microbiome proliferation, promote anti-inflammation, and reducing anxiety-like behaviors signaling a direct effect on our brain function trough the gut-brain axis. However, it’s not just the nervous system that is the point of action for the prebiotics. As you build up your fiber intake, the accretion of the chewing time in the oral cavity can promote saliva and gastric acid production, which also contributes towards higher satiety (Parnell et al, 2006). This also affects our insulin, and ghrelin (hunger hormones) secretions, eventually regulating our food intake and promoting satiation (van der beek et al, 2018). However, the most interesting claim for prebiotic intake is the supposed health implications on our gut immunity. One may be confused about the term “gut immunity”, and rightly so. Though it is well known that our immune system is composed of several barriers, our gut encounters the majority of antigens, and any immunogenic compromise can have adverse health effects almost immediately. So, it is no surprise that the major player in our immune system is located in our gastrointestinal tract – gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). GALT induces immune reaction by activating T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells in response to pathogenic entry and prebiotics can enhance our GALT’s action. SCFAs are known to reduce the occurrence of colon cancer, colitis, and may also inhibit colonization of pathogenic bacteria to our epithelial lining through anti-inflammatory pathways (Komiyama et al, 2011; Rivera-Huerta et al, 2017; Rani et al, 2019). Among other functions, SCFAs also act as signaling factors and increase the production of regulatory T cells, improving our gut immunity (Freitas et al, 2014). SCFAs produced by our gut microbiome also increase calcium bioavailability, thereby increasing our bone density and improving iron absorption. Epidemiological research has also suggested a link between a low prebiotic diet and cardiovascular diseases (Kochar et al, 2007; Tang et al, 2019). SCFAs alter lipid metabolism, and possibly lower your risk for heart diseases, by reducing the LDL cholesterol serum concentrations. Overall, the promising benefits of prebiotics promote them as a powerful tool for altering your microbial composition and to strengthen your immunity.REFERENCESBurokas, Aurelijus, Arboleya, Silvia, Moloney, Rachel D, Peterson, Veronica L, Murphy, Kiera, Clarke, Gerard, Stanton, Catherine, Dinan, Timothy G, & Cryan, John F.

Prions,"prions, viruses",What is life?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/what-is-life/,"April 16, 2022","Classification oflifeBiology is the study of life.  Once upon a time, there were just two types of lifeforms, animals and plants.  If something wasn’t clearly an animal, well, it  was classified as a plant, which included fungi, algae and even bacteria.  Today, we can see the errors in judgement of this two category system for which the science of biology was named and founded.  Today though, with great advancements in taxonomy based on molecular biology, the distinctions between these various lineages are very clear.  However, that is for what we can neatly and completely classify as life.  The grey areas of recent biology are in the microbiological world, not prokaryotic cells, but even smaller than that, the complex aggregations of chemicals that sit at the interface between life and non-life.  Are they extraordinarily complex aggregations of chemicals or extraordinarily simple forms of life?  It is open to debate, and a fascinating one it is.  We start our discussion below by considering what life is, then covering an overview of prions, viroids and viruses as the three biological entities, infectious biological entities, that appear not to fit the definition of life, at least not as we currently know and define it.Criteria for lifeA fascinating aspect of biology is delving into the criteria of what is life.  What are living and non-living entities in the biological world?  Animals, plants, fungi and the various Protisan macro- and microorganisms are quite obviously life, as are Bacteria and the other forms of prokaryotic life, the Archaea.  However, where does that leave the sub-cellular biological entities that are not capable of free existence?  Parker (1953), inAmerican Scientist41:614, said that four (main) criteria defined – growth, movement, reproduction and metabolism.  Certainly, these are a bit vague, like for example what does “movement” mean?  Does that mean plants are non-living as they don’t fulfil these criteria?  It is an interesting debate, a debate that has been complicated with the discovery and in-depth analysis of biological entities that fit few of the criteria of life, yet are dominant in their specific ecological niche.  Earlier, it just just viruses, but then the discovery of viroids and subsequently prions, has just really opened up a whole new world of parasitic relationships and indeed, has really redefined parasitism.Really though, should we care? should it bother us? is this purely of academic, scholarly interest only and something that has not practical value in the “real-world”?  Perhaps, yes, but the natural world, and it’s categories have always been an important way or ordering what we see.  This started of course with Linnaean taxonomy, based on phenotypic differences, which has led to molecular-based differentiation.  Ordering the natural world, the biological world, allows a systematic investigation and therefore one would think, a more thorough analysis of the significant challenges that each one of these presents to humanity, either directly or indirectly.Direct impact can of course be human disease, but then we have indirect impacts through economic losses of agricultural crops or livestock.  Thus, these sub-cellular biological entities that sit at the boundary between living and non-living have certainly been able to wreak substantial chaos on humanity.PrionsPrion diseases are a group of rare, fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and animals.Prion diseases are caused by an infectious agent called prions. Prions are misfolded proteins that can cause other proteins to misfold in the same way.  They are the only known biological agents that can replicate themselves without a nucleic acid template in the host cell. The disease is transmitted when people or animals eat food contaminated with the prion protein.The most common form of human prion disease is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD affects about one person per million each year worldwide. It usually starts with personality changes, difficulty walking, and problems with coordination. As the disease progresses, mental function becomes impaired and involuntary jerking movements may appear. Death usually occurs within a year of diagnosis, often from respiratory or cardiac failure.ViroidsA viroid is a type of virus that infects plants. Viroid infection can cause stunting, wilting, and yellowing of the plant.Viroid infection can be caused by a number of different types of viroid. The most common type is the potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd). This viroid is transmitted by aphids and causes the potato to produce misshapen tubers.VirusesA virus is a small infectious agent that can only replicate inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.Viruses consist of two or three parts: genetic material made from either DNA or RNA; a protein coat called a capsid; and sometimes an envelope of lipids that surrounds the virus. The genetic material inside the virus may be single-stranded or double-stranded DNA or RNA. The capsid is made from proteins and sometimes contains materials like metal ions which give the virus its shape. The envelope is made from lipids (fats) and proteins, but no genetic material.Viral diversity","biology, microbiology, taxonomy, viroids, virology, virus"
Prions,prions,Prions and beef.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prions-and-beef/,"March 25, 2020","In case you want a break from SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, we consider something a bit different in this blog article and discuss a simpler infectious agent than viruses.  Viruses are already considered non-living or not life forms, meaning they don’t fulfil the criteria for life.  Yet there is something out there even simpler in its composition, but at least as feared and deadly (or perhaps more so), even compared with the most virulent and ‘dangerous’ viruses.  I’m talking about prions.  In  between prions and viruses, there is actually another infectious agent – viroids.  These are plant pathogens solely comprised on single-stranded RNA – but we won’t discuss viroids.  The text commencing from the paragraph below is an extract from a report I wrote in 1997 on the molecular biology of prion diseases.  Prion diseases are all neurodegenerative and infect both humans and animals alike.  They can be zoonotic and are most well known as the cause of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly known as mad cow disease.  The foodborne connection took place in rather dramatic fashion over an approximate ten year period from the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s, with a peak during 1992 and 1993.  At this time, infected beef from slaughtered cattle with BSE was identified as the cause of Variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD) (Figure 1), one of the human forms of this disease.  It’s reported that nearly 4½ million cattle were killed in the UK at this time (Figure 2) in an attempt to stamp out the disease by preventing infected beef from entering the food supply chain.  To date, some 230 people have acquired vCJD, which has no treatment, no cure, and a 100% mortality rate.  All but three reported cases were foodborne, through consumption of infected beef approximately ten years before the onset of symptoms.Figure 1: BSE and vCJD – zoonotic and foodborne.Figure 2: Slaughtered cattle during the UK BSE outbreak of the 1990s.The diseases caused by prions have been known for a long time, for around 250 years in fact.  Waterson and Wilkinson (1978) report that scrapie was first observed in the 1770s in certain parts of Europe, such as Great Britain, where it has been a major problem in recent history.  Since then, interest has only escalated in recent years with more detailed molecular methods available for their study.  We now that prions are the causal agent of ten diseases, of which four affect animals and the remaining six effect humans (Figure 3).  Due to the very nature of prions, these diseases are unique (like prions themselves) in that they can be infectious and genetic.  The animal diseases such as scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) have received most of the attention, although the human diseases are increasing in awareness, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and German-Straussler-Scheinker (GSS) syndrome.  Generally the animal diseases are regarded as being infectious while the human diseases are infectious or genetic, with some, like CJD being both genetic and infectious.  All are characterised as being neurodegenerative.Figure 3: The diseases caused by prions.Prions, as the infectious agents that cause the above mentioned diseases lack any nucleic acid.  Nucleic acid is either DNA or RNA, and is generally considered the ‘blue print’ for life, life processes or at least infectious processes.  Therefore, prions are infectious proteins, or proteinaceous infectious agents, from which the name prion is derived.  At the molecular level, prion diseases are centred around two forms of the prion protein, one being misfolded and infective and the other not (Figure 4).  These proteins are normally produced in the body and are therefore coded for by a host gene.  A proper definition of a prion would be timely, and such a definition is given by CDC (2018) who say that prions are “…abnormal, pathogenic agents that are transmissible and are able to induce abnormal folding of specific normal cellular proteins called prion proteins that are found most abundantly in the brain” – yes, a bit of a definition there to take in.Figure 4: Normal protein on the left and the infectious misfolded protein on the right.The idea of an infectious protein was first suggested by Prusiner (1982) who coined the term ‘prion’.  As could be expected, this proposal was received by the scientific community with much doubt, and even in 1997, still was to some extent.  However, the concept is gradually being accepted as evidence mounts.  This was because every pathogen, or infectious agent, up to that time had nucleic acid, and it is the major component in the most important biological processes or replication or reproduction, basically, for continuity of the agent.  Viruses were generally considered to be the simplest infectious agents (being a ‘simple’ package of nucleic acid surrounded by protein) (Figure 5), but the isolation and purification of viroids (which might be the topic of another whole blog post) and especially prions put a whole new complexion on this thinking.Figure 5: The simple structure of a virus.There are many fundamental differences between prions and everything else in the biological world that makes them impossible to include in any previously described category.  The most significant of these is their lack of any type of nucleic acid.  At first, DNA was thought to be an essential component of a pathogen.  However, RNA viruses were subsequently discovered, and now we have something infectious with no nucleic acid at all.  How can it survive? replicate? and be infective?  All of these functions are possible as it relies on the host’s DNA.  It was a very bold statement to say that an infectious agent does not contain any nucleic acid, and therefore much research was carried out to demonstrate such a theory was valid.   This was done by using a variety of methods which are commonly used to degrade DNA, which were shown to not alter the infectivity of the prion protein that causes scrapie, the name of the prion disease of sheep.  Many such methods were used by Prusiner (1982) in order to formulate his prion theory – for example, ultraviolet (UV) radiation and reagents like nucleases, hydroxyl amine, psoralen and zinc ions.  These were not found to have any effect and neither did ionising radiation tested by Alperet al.(1978).  This large amount of testing performed must surely support the theory of the absence of nucleic acid in prions.  To support the theory of an infective protein, research was intensified in the early 1980s to isolate the protein.  The work of Prusineret al.(1982) and McKinleyet al.(1983) identified the protein soon after the prion concept was proposed.  The protease resistant core of the protein, designated PrP 27-30, was isolated from experimental hamsters, but could not be found in the control animals.  Figure 6 gives a summary of what we know today or prion biology.Figure 6: Summary of the evidence to support the theory of prions.ReferencesAlper, T., Haig, D.A. & Clarke, M.C. (1978).

Probiotics and gut health,"fermented-foods, immunity, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",The Role of Fermented Foods in Enhancing Immunity: Insights from Recent Studies,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-role-of-fermented-foods-in-enhancing-immunity-insights-from-recent-studies/,"May 9, 2024","By: Zixian Zhao – Cancer immunologistat Food Microbiology AcademyIn the realm of nutritional science, the connection between diet and immune health has been extensively explored, revealing complex interactions that influence overall health. Recent studies have particularly highlighted the role of fermented foods in modulating the immune system, offering promising avenues for enhancing immune responses and managing various health conditions. This blog article delves into the findings from recent research to unpack how fermented foods can be pivotal in boosting immunity.Understanding Immunity and NutritionOur immune system, a sophisticated network of cells and proteins, serves as the body’s defence against infections. The critical role of nutrition in supporting immune function is well-documented, highlighting that proper nutrients are essential for robust immune health and disease prevention. Unlike simple probiotic supplements, fermented foods sometimes contain live cultures that can function as probiotics,  often bacteria and sometimes yeasts that are integral to gut health—a major player in immunological well-being.  Furthermore, the fermentation process results in a myriad of metabolic compounds, many of which are of much benefit to human health.Key Findings from Recent ResearchNutritional Control of Immunity: The interaction between diet and immune cell functionality is intricate. According to Veronica De Rosa and her team, dietary components profoundly influence the equilibrium between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory processes, thus impacting health outcomes significantly (De Rosa et al., 2015).Nutritional Immunology: Fleur Ponton and colleagues discuss the multifaceted relationship between malnutrition—both under-nutrition and over-nutrition—and immune impairment, which heightens disease vulnerability (Ponton et al., 2011).Fermented Foods and Immune Modulation: Upasana Sarma and Suchandra Gupta’s research on Indian ethnic fermented foods illustrates how microbial activity in these foods not only fills nutritional voids but also enhances immunity across various populations (Sarma & Gupta, 2022).Clinical Implications for Cancer Patients: In a pivotal study, Nan Lin et al. found that fermented vegetables could alleviate adverse effects in esophageal cancer patients undergoing combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy, by bolstering nutritional and immunological parameters (Lin et al., 2022).Fermented Foods in Experimental Models: Investigations into Xeniji, a fermented food product, have demonstrated its potential to bolster antioxidant levels and immune responses in mice, highlighting the health-supportive properties of fermented foods (Zulkawi et al., 2017), at least in a mouse model.The Science Behind Fermented Foods and ImmunityFermented foods enhance immunity primarily through their impact on gut health. The fermentation process increases the bioavailability of nutrients, which can better support immune functions. Additionally, the microorganisms that are sometimes present in fermented foods help balance the gut microbiome, a critical element for a healthy immune system. By improving gut health, fermented foods indirectly enhance immune responses and reduce inflammation.Practical ApplicationsIncorporating fermented foods into the diet can be a strategic approach to improve immune health. Examples include:Yogurt and Kefir: Rich in lactobacilli, these foods can enhance gut flora and immune function.Kimchi and Sauerkraut: These fermented vegetables are high in vitamins that can help boost the immune system.Expanding on Fermented Foods and Immune HealthGlobally, fermented foods are integral to many traditional diets and are prized for their distinct flavours and health-promoting properties, especially in enhancing immune health. These foods boost immunity largely by improving gut health. The fermentation process enriches the availability of nutrients, thereby supporting the immune system more effectively. Although fermentation does not generate probiotics, it cultivates conditions that encourage the growth of beneficial bacteria, including probiotics, provided they are part of the initial ingredients. By promoting a balanced gut microbiome, fermented foods indirectly bolster immune function and mitigate inflammation.Future Research Directions in Fermented Foods and ImmunityFuture research on fermented foods and immune health should focus on identifying specific probiotic strains with the highest therapeutic potential, understanding the mechanisms through which these foods influence immune cells via the gut microbiota, and assessing the long-term health impacts of their regular consumption. Studies could also explore the role of fermented foods in managing non-communicable diseases through immune modulation and develop personalised nutrition strategies based on individual microbiome differences. This targeted research could lead to more precise dietary recommendations and innovative health solutions.ConclusionThe intersection of nutrition and immune health is a critical area of study, particularly in the context of increasing health issues related to poor dietary choices. Fermented foods, especially those with a rich probiotic content have health-enhancing properties, and offer a valuable tool for improving immune health. As research continues to unfold, it becomes clear that integrating fermented foods into daily dietary practices can be a beneficial strategy for maintaining health and preventing disease.In conclusion, while more clinical trials and research are needed to fully understand the optimal types and quantities of fermented foods for health benefits, the current evidence strongly supports their role in promoting a healthy immune system and overall health. Incorporating these foods into a balanced diet, alongside other healthful practices, could potentially lead to better health outcomes and a stronger immune systemReferencesDe Rosa, V., Galgani, M., Santopaolo, M., Colamatteo, A., Laccetti, R., & Matarese, G.

Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Probiotics in gut health and immunity,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/probiotics-in-gut-health-and-immunity/,"April 3, 2024","Probiotics, often hailed as the guardians of gut health, have taken centre stage in the narrative of nutritional science and wellness. Their role extends beyond mere digestion aid, intertwining with the intricate workings of the immune system. This blog post delves into the multifaceted influence of probiotics on gut health and immunity, uncovering the science behind their beneficial effects.Probiotics explainedProbiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. These beneficial bacteria and yeasts are predominantly found in fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and kombucha, or as dietary supplements. They are known to enhance gut flora, or the microbiome, which is a complex community of microorganisms living in our intestines...The gut microbiome: A central player in healthThe gut microbiome plays a crucial role in the body’s overall health, affecting everything from digestion and nutrient absorption to immune function and even mental health. A balanced gut microbiome helps to break down food, synthesise vitamins, and protect against pathogens. Probiotics contribute to this balance, adding to the diversity and functionality of the gut’s microbial community.Probiotics and gut healthThe relationship between probiotics and gut health is symbiotic. Probiotics aid in maintaining a healthy intestinal environment by:Enhancing the intestinal barrier: They strengthen the gut lining, preventing harmful substances and pathogens from leaking into the body.Balancing the microbiome: Probiotics help restore and maintain a healthy balance of gut bacteria, especially after disruptions caused by antibiotics, poor diet, or illness.Supporting digestion and nutrient absorption: They assist in breaking down food and absorbing nutrients, which is crucial for overall health.Immunity boost through gut healthA significant portion of the immune system resides in the gut, making gut health and immunity deeply interconnected. Probiotics influence the immune system by:Regulating immune responses: Probiotics can modulate the immune system, enhancing its ability to fight off infections while also preventing excessive inflammation, often associated with autoimmune diseases.Producing antimicrobial substances: Some probiotics produce substances that have antimicrobial properties, which can directly combat pathogenic bacteria.Enhancing mucosal immunity: Probiotics stimulate the activity of mucosal immune cells, boosting the body’s first line of defense against pathogens.Probiotics in disease prevention and managementResearch suggests that probiotics can play a role in preventing and managing various health conditions, particularly those related to gut health and immune function, such as:Gastrointestinal disorders: Probiotics are beneficial in managing conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and infectious diarrhea.Immune-related conditions: Regular intake of probiotics has been linked to reduced severity and frequency of respiratory infections, allergies, and certain autoimmune disorders.Mental health: Emerging evidence supports the role of probiotics in improving mood and cognitive function, shedding light on the gut-brain axis.Choosing the right probioticsThe probiotic world is diverse, with different strains offering specific health benefits. The efficacy of probiotics depends on the strain, dosage, and individual health conditions. For example,Lactobacillus rhamnosusGG andSaccharomyces boulardiihave been extensively studied for their positive effects on gastrointestinal health..Incorporating probiotics into the dietTo reap the benefits of probiotics, incorporating them into the daily diet is key. Fermented foods naturally rich in probiotics and high-quality supplements can be excellent sources. However, it’s crucial to ensure that these products contain live and active cultures and to consider the specific strains and quantities needed to achieve desired health effects.Future perspectivesThe field of probiotics is expanding, with ongoing research exploring their potential in treating and preventing a broader range of health issues. Personalised probiotics and the role of prebiotics (fibres that feed beneficial bacteria) are areas of growing interest, promising more targeted and effective interventions for individual health needs.ConclusionIn conclusion, probiotics play a pivotal role in promoting gut health and strengthening immunity. Their benefits, spanning from enhancing digestive health to modulating immune responses, make them a valuable component of daily nutrition. As we continue to unravel the complexities of the gut microbiome and its impact on health, probiotics stand out as a key player in the quest for optimal well-being..","food microbiology, gut health, gut microbiome, gut microflora, health, immunology, nutrition, probiotics"
Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, probiotics-and-gut-health, public-health",The rise of probiotics in animal agriculture,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-rise-of-probiotics-in-animal-agriculture/,"December 3, 2023","Decades of widespread antibiotic use in food production animals have given rise to a global problem with far-reaching implications for human health, animal welfare, and environmental sustainability. The practice of administering antibiotics to livestock and poultry was initially embraced for its perceived benefits in promoting growth and preventing diseases within crowded and often unsanitary conditions. However, the unintended consequences of this routine antibiotic use have triggered a multifaceted crisis.The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in food production has been a primary driver of antibiotic resistance, a global health crisis that jeopardises the effectiveness of these crucial drugs in treating bacterial infections. The constant exposure of bacteria to low levels of antibiotics in animal agriculture creates an environment where bacteria can develop resistance mechanisms. Resistant bacteria can then spread to humans through the consumption of contaminated food products, direct contact with animals, or exposure to contaminated environmental sources.The transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from food animals to humans poses severe risks to public health. Resistant infections are more challenging to treat, often requiring stronger and more expensive antibiotics with increased potential for adverse side effects. In extreme cases, antibiotic-resistant infections can result in prolonged illnesses, increased mortality rates, and a higher burden on healthcare systems.

Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Unraveling the gut health puzzle: Why prebiotics are more important than probiotics,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/unraveling-the-gut-health-puzzle-why-prebiotics-are-more-important-than-probiotics/,"October 29, 2023","The world of gut health has been abuzz with the terms “probiotics” and “prebiotics.” These words have become synonymous with digestive well-being, but what’s often overlooked is the vital role prebiotics play in maintaining a healthy gut. While probiotics undoubtedly offer benefits, it’s increasingly clear that prebiotics, the unsung heroes, may be even more important in promoting a balanced and thriving gut microbiome. In this article, we’ll explore why prebiotics should take center stage in your quest for digestive health.Defining the terms: Probiotics vs. prebioticsBefore delving into their respective roles, let’s clarify what probiotics and prebiotics are:Probioticsare live beneficial microorganisms, primarily bacteria and some yeasts, that can enhance the gut’s microbial balance when consumed. Common sources include yogurt, kefir, and dietary supplements.Prebiotics, on the other hand, are non-digestible fibers or compounds that serve as nourishment for beneficial gut bacteria, helping them grow and thrive. They are found in various foods, such as onions, garlic, and certain whole grains.The gut microbiome: A complex ecosystemThe human gut is a bustling ecosystem comprising trillions of microorganisms, collectively known as the gut microbiome. This microbial community plays a crucial role in digestion, immune function, and even mental health. A balanced gut microbiome contributes to overall well-being.Why probiotics are importantProbiotics have garnered significant attention and research due to their potential to introduce beneficial microorganisms into the gut. They can help restore microbial balance, support digestion, and offer some potential health benefits. However, probiotics have limitations:Transient nature: Probiotics are transient visitors. They don’t permanently establish themselves in the gut. To maintain their benefits, you must consistently consume probiotic-rich foods or supplements.Variability: The effectiveness of probiotics varies between individuals. Factors such as the type of probiotic strain, dosage, and individual gut conditions can impact their success.Survival challenges: Probiotic microorganisms can face challenges in surviving stomach acid and reaching the intestines in sufficient numbers to be effective.Limited impact: While probiotics can provide relief for some digestive conditions, their impact is often modest compared to the role of prebiotics in nurturing existing beneficial bacteria.The prebiotic advantagePrebiotics, in contrast, offer a more sustainable and profound impact on gut health:Selective nourishment: Prebiotics serve as a specific food source for beneficial gut bacteria. This nourishment encourages the growth and activity of these microbes, contributing to a balanced gut microbiome.Diversity and resilience: Prebiotics support the growth of a wide range of beneficial bacteria. A diverse gut microbiome is more resilient to disturbances and better equipped to perform essential functions.Long-lasting effects: Unlike probiotics, prebiotics have a lasting impact on gut health. They promote the growth of native, beneficial microbes that can continue to thrive and function effectively over time.Improved digestion and health: Prebiotics can enhance the absorption of nutrients, support bowel regularity, and strengthen the gut’s protective barrier. They are linked to improved digestion and a reduced risk of certain health conditions.Finding prebiotics in your dietPrebiotics can be readily incorporated into your daily diet through various food sources, including:Fruits: Bananas, apples, and citrus fruits are rich in prebiotic fibers.Vegetables: Garlic, onions, leeks, and asparagus are excellent sources.Whole grains: Oats, barley, and whole wheat contain prebiotic compounds.Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, and black beans are good choices.Nuts and seeds: Almonds and flaxseeds provide prebiotic benefits.Inulin supplements: Inulin is a type of prebiotic fibre available in supplement form.A holistic approach to gut healthWhile probiotics can be valuable in specific situations, they should complement, rather than replace, a diet rich in prebiotic-rich foods. A holistic approach to gut health includes both elements, with prebiotics serving as the foundation for nurturing your gut microbiome.By prioritising prebiotics in your diet, you empower your body to support its natural, beneficial microorganisms, creating an environment where they can thrive. This approach contributes to a resilient, diverse, and balanced gut microbiome that, in turn, supports overall health and well-being.In conclusion, the world of gut health should focus on the prebiotic side of the equation. While probiotics have their merits, prebiotics offer long-lasting, selective nourishment that can foster a thriving, resilient gut microbiome. Make prebiotic-rich foods a staple in your diet, and you’ll be taking a significant step toward digestive well-being and overall health.","food microbiology, food science, gut health, probiotics"
Probiotics and gut health,"fermented-foods, food-quality, probiotics-and-gut-health",A journey through the history of food microbiology,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/a-journey-through-the-history-of-food-microbiology/,"October 24, 2023","The world of food is not merely a feast for the senses; it is a realm teeming with invisible life. The study of food microbiology, a fascinating and indispensable branch of science, has revealed the hidden microcosm that plays a pivotal role in the production, preservation, and safety of the food we consume. As we delve into the annals of history, we’ll unearth the remarkable journey of food microbiology, from its nascent beginnings to its crucial role in contemporary food science and safety.The dawn of microbiologyThe story of food microbiology commences in the early 17th century when the Dutch merchant and amateur scientist, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, crafted simple microscopes and laid the groundwork for microbiology as a whole. Using these rudimentary devices, Leeuwenhoek examined various biological samples, including water and tiny flecks of food. In 1676, he became the first person to witness bacteria through a microscope, marking the dawn of microbiology.Spontaneous generation and fermentationIn the centuries that followed, the relationship between microorganisms and food remained largely uncharted territory. The prevailing belief was in spontaneous generation, the idea that life could arise spontaneously from non-living matter. For example, it was widely believed that food spoilage was a result of spontaneous generation rather than the activity of microorganisms.It was not until the 18th century that scientist Lazzaro Spallanzani conducted groundbreaking experiments to refute the theory of spontaneous generation. His meticulous work with food preservation, particularly the sealing of broth in sterile containers, demonstrated that food spoilage could be prevented by preventing the entry of microorganisms.Another pivotal figure in the history of food microbiology is Louis Pasteur, who conducted extensive research on the fermentation processes used in food and beverage production. In the mid-19th century, Pasteur demonstrated that microorganisms were responsible for fermentation in products like wine, beer, and bread. His work laid the foundation for the controlled fermentation processes we use in the food industry today.The birth of modern food microbiologyThe late 19th and early 20th centuries saw a surge in scientific understanding of food microbiology. This period witnessed the identification of specific microorganisms responsible for foodborne illnesses and the development of technologies to combat foodborne pathogens.One pivotal discovery came in the late 19th century when Robert Koch, a pioneering figure in medical microbiology, isolated the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis. This marked a significant step in the identification of pathogenic microorganisms in food. Soon after, scientists identified bacteria such asSalmonellaandEscherichia coli(E. coli) as the culprits behind foodborne illnesses, leading to the development of the first food safety regulations and guidelines.The advent of food preservation methodsWith the understanding of microorganisms’ role in food spoilage and foodborne illnesses, researchers began to develop food preservation methods that harnessed this knowledge. One such method, pasteurisation, was named after Louis Pasteur. It involved heating food products to specific temperatures for a set duration to kill harmful microorganisms while preserving the food’s quality. Pasteurization remains a crucial food processing method, used for dairy products, juices, and various beverages.The 19th century also saw the development of canning, a method that involved sealing food in airtight containers to prevent microbial contamination. This method, pioneered by Nicolas Appert and later perfected by Louis Pasteur, revolutionized food preservation and contributed to the global expansion of food industries.The era of microbiological standards and regulationsAs the food industry grew, so did concerns about food safety. The need for standardized procedures and regulations to ensure the microbiological safety of food became apparent. In the early 20th century, the United States established the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, marking one of the earliest efforts to regulate food safety. This act laid the foundation for the creation of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1930.Around the same time, microbiological standards were developed, setting limits on the permissible levels of certain microorganisms in food products. These standards helped ensure the safety of food by regulating the number of harmful microorganisms allowed in products.The discovery of antibiotics and food microbiologyThe discovery of antibiotics in the mid-20th century had a significant impact on food microbiology. Antibiotics like penicillin and tetracycline were not only used to treat human infections but also found applications in agriculture and food production. They were used to control bacterial contaminants and diseases in livestock, contributing to increased food safety.However, the overuse of antibiotics in agriculture has raised concerns about antibiotic resistance in foodborne pathogens. This issue continues to be a subject of study and regulatory efforts in contemporary food microbiology.Modern food microbiologyThe late 20th century and early 21st century have witnessed a proliferation of advanced techniques and tools in food microbiology. Molecular biology, genomics, and bioinformatics have provided scientists with unprecedented insights into the microbial communities present in food and their impact on safety and quality.Techniques like polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing have enabled the rapid and accurate detection and identification of microorganisms in food. This has been invaluable for tracking outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, investigating contamination sources, and ensuring the safety of food products.The field of food microbiology has also expanded its scope to include the study of probiotics, prebiotics, and the human microbiome. Probiotics are beneficial microorganisms that can improve gut health and overall well-being when consumed in certain food products. Prebiotics, on the other hand, are non-digestible compounds that support the growth of beneficial gut bacteria.Challenges and future directionsAs our understanding of food microbiology continues to grow, so do the challenges we face. The globalization of food production and distribution has made it increasingly difficult to monitor and control foodborne pathogens. Emerging pathogens and antimicrobial resistance are ongoing concerns that require constant vigilance and research.Additionally, the demand for more sustainable and environmentally friendly food production practices is driving innovation in food microbiology. The development of alternative protein sources, such as plant-based and cell-cultured meats, presents new challenges and opportunities in terms of microbial safety and quality control.ConclusionThe history of food microbiology is a testament to the ever-evolving relationship between science and our culinary world. From the humble observations of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek to the advanced molecular techniques of today, food microbiology has uncovered the invisible forces that shape the safety and quality of our food.As we move forward, the challenges of a globalised food supply chain, emerging pathogens, and the quest for sustainable food production will continue to shape the field. With the lessons of the past as our guide, food microbiology will play a critical role in ensuring that our meals are not only delicious but also safe and sustainable for generations to come.","food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology, probiotics"

Alginate, a naturally occurring polysaccharide derived from seaweed, offers excellent properties for the encapsulation of probiotics due to its biocompatibility, gel-forming ability, and protective nature. This overview explores the use of alginate-based systems for the microencapsulation of probiotic bacteria, highlighting its advantages, techniques, and potential applications.Alginate-based microencapsulation provides a protective matrix that surrounds the probiotic bacteria, shielding them from harsh environmental conditions. The encapsulation process involves the formation of gel beads by mixing alginate with the probiotic bacteria and subsequently cross-linking the alginate using divalent cations like calcium ions. The resulting gel matrix encapsulates the bacteria, forming microspheres or beads that protect them from factors such as low pH, bile salts, and oxygen exposure.One of the key advantages of alginate-based microencapsulation is its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Alginate is considered safe for human consumption, making it an ideal material for encapsulating probiotics intended for oral administration. It is resistant to enzymatic degradation in the stomach, ensuring the survival of the encapsulated bacteria during transit through the gastrointestinal tract.Alginate systems offer versatility in terms of probiotic strain selection and formulation. Various strains of probiotic bacteria, includingLactobacillus,Bifidobacterium, andSaccharomyces, have been successfully encapsulated using alginate-based systems. Additionally, alginate can be combined with other polymers or bioactive compounds to enhance the encapsulation efficiency and stability of probiotics, or to achieve specific release profiles.The encapsulation process can be performed using different techniques, including extrusion, emulsion, or droplet-based methods. Extrusion is a commonly used technique in which a probiotic-alginate mixture is passed through a syringe or nozzle to form droplets that are subsequently cross-linked. Emulsion-based methods involve the dispersion of the probiotic-alginate mixture in an immiscible organic solvent, followed by hardening and purification steps. These techniques allow for the production of uniform and well-defined microcapsules with controlled sizes and encapsulation efficiencies.The advantages of alginate-based microencapsulation extend beyond protection and stability. The release profile of the encapsulated probiotics can be tailored by adjusting the alginate concentration, cross-linking density, or incorporating other materials. This enables a controlled release of probiotic bacteria, facilitating their colonization in the gut and maximising their therapeutic effects.The applications of alginate-based microencapsulation of probiotics are vast. It is commonly used in the development of functional foods, dietary supplements, and pharmaceutical formulations.

The calcium ions cross-link the alginate, forming gel beads that encapsulate the probiotics. These beads provide a protective matrix for the bacteria, enhancing their survival and stability.Double Coating with Alginate: Another approach is the double coating method, which involves the sequential encapsulation of probiotic bacteria using two layers of alginate. The first layer consists of a thicker alginate coating to provide initial protection, followed by a thinner outer layer that helps improve mechanical stability and reduce diffusional loss of bacteria. This double coating system offers enhanced protection and controlled release of probiotics.Alginate-Chitosan Coating: Alginate can also be combined with chitosan, a natural polysaccharide derived from crustacean shells, to create a multilayered coating for probiotics. The combination of alginate and chitosan offers improved stability, controlled release, and enhanced resistance to harsh gastrointestinal conditions. The alginate-chitosan microencapsulation system provides an additional layer of protection for probiotic bacteria.Alginate-Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Microcapsules: The incorporation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) into alginate-based microencapsulation systems has been explored to enhance the viability and functionality of probiotics. PEG provides additional stability, improves mechanical strength, and reduces water uptake of alginate microcapsules. This combination increases the survival of probiotic bacteria during processing, storage, and passage through the digestive system.Alginate-Lipid Hybrid Microcapsules: Alginate can be combined with lipids to form hybrid microcapsules for encapsulating probiotics. The incorporation of lipids improves the stability and release properties of alginate microcapsules. Lipids can be used to modify the permeability of the capsules, allowing controlled release of the encapsulated probiotics. This hybrid microencapsulation system offers potential advantages for targeted delivery and sustained release of probiotic bacteria.These examples highlight the versatility and potential of alginate-based microencapsulation systems for probiotic bacteria. Each system offers unique features and benefits, such as enhanced stability, controlled release, and improved survival of probiotics during storage and digestion. The choice of a specific system depends on the desired properties, application, and specific requirements of the probiotic formulation. Ongoing research and innovation in the field continue to explore new and improved alginate-based microencapsulation systems for the efficient delivery of probiotics.","food microbiology, food science, microencapsulation, probiotics"
Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Delving into prebiotics and how they benefit our health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/delving-into-prebiotics-and-how-they-benefit-our-health/,"May 8, 2023","Prebiotics are non-digestible fibers or carbohydrates that serve as food for the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. They are typically found in plant-based foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Prebiotics cannot be broken down by the human digestive system, so they pass through the stomach and small intestine undigested and reach the colon intact.Once in the colon, prebiotics are fermented by the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. This fermentation process produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are the main source of energy for the cells lining the colon. SCFAs also play an important role in maintaining gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria and inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria.Prebiotics are beneficial to our health in many ways. They have been shown to improve digestive health, boost immunity, lower inflammation, and improve metabolic health. They also help to maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in the gut microbiota, which is important for overall health and wellbeing.Examples of prebiotics include inulin, fructooligosaccharides (FOS), galactooligosaccharides (GOS), and resistant starch. These compounds are found in foods like bananas, onions, garlic, asparagus, oats, and legumes. To maximize the prebiotic content of your diet, it’s important to consume a variety of fiber-rich plant-based foods.Inulin is a type of prebiotic dietary fiber that is found in a variety of plant-based foods. It is a complex carbohydrate that is made up of chains of fructose molecules, and it is resistant to digestion in the human small intestine. Inulin is fermented by the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that provide energy to the cells lining the colon and promote gut health.Inulin is commonly extracted from plants like chicory root, Jerusalem artichoke, and agave. It is used as an ingredient in a variety of food products, including yogurts, bars, cereals, and baked goods, as well as dietary supplements. Inulin is often added to foods to increase their fiber content and improve their nutritional profile.Research has shown that consuming inulin may have several health benefits, including improving digestive health, boosting immunity, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Additionally, inulin has been found to increase feelings of fullness and aid in weight management, making it a popular ingredient in weight loss products.Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS) are both types of prebiotic dietary fibers that serve as food for the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. However, there are some differences between the two.FOS are made up of chains of fructose molecules, while GOS are made up of chains of galactose molecules. Both FOS and GOS are resistant to digestion in the small intestine, and they are fermented by the beneficial bacteria in the colon, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) that provide energy to the cells lining the colon and promote gut health.FOS are commonly found in foods like chicory root, onions, garlic, and asparagus. They have a slightly sweet taste and are often used as a natural sweetener in food products. FOS have been shown to improve digestive health, boost immunity, and lower inflammation.GOS are less commonly found in food, but they can be synthesized from lactose, which is found in milk. GOS are often added to infant formula to mimic the prebiotic effects of human milk. GOS have been shown to improve gut health and reduce the risk of infections in infants.Overall, FOS and GOS are similar in their prebiotic effects and health benefits, but they have different chemical structures and sources. Both can be beneficial to consume as part of a healthy diet.Prebiotic resistant starch is a type of dietary fiber that is resistant to digestion in the small intestine and serves as food for the beneficial bacteria in our gut microbiota. Resistant starch is a form of starch that is not broken down by digestive enzymes in the small intestine and instead reaches the colon intact, where it is fermented by the gut microbiota.Resistant starch is found in foods like legumes, whole grains, green bananas, and potatoes that have been cooked and then cooled. When these foods are cooked and cooled, the starch molecules undergo a process called retrogradation, which increases their resistance to digestion.Research has shown that consuming prebiotic resistant starch may have several health benefits, including improving digestive health, reducing inflammation, and lowering the risk of chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer. Prebiotic resistant starch has also been found to improve insulin sensitivity and aid in weight management by increasing feelings of fullness.It’s important to note that not all types of starch are prebiotic resistant starch. For example, highly processed foods like white bread and white rice have very little resistant starch, while whole grain bread and brown rice have higher amounts. To increase your intake of prebiotic resistant starch, it’s recommended to consume a variety of whole foods that are rich in resistant starch.","food microbiology, food science, gut health, gut microbiome, gut microflora, microbiology"

The gut contains over 100 million neurons, which communicate with the brain via the vagus nerve. This communication plays a vital role in regulating mood, behavior, and cognitive function.The gut microbiome and its impact on mental healthThe gut microbiome refers to the collection of microorganisms that live in the gut. This microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining gut health, and research has shown that it also has a significant impact on mental health. The gut microbiome communicates with the brain via the gut-brain axis, which means that an imbalance in the microbiome can have a direct impact on mental health.Studies have shown that people with depression and anxiety often have an imbalance in their gut microbiome. This imbalance can lead to inflammation, which is a known contributor to mental health issues. Additionally, an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to nutrient deficiencies, which can further contribute to mental health problems.The link between gut health and anxietyAnxiety is a common mental health disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. While the causes of anxiety are complex and varied, research has shown that gut health plays a significant role in its development. Studies have found that people with anxiety often have an imbalance in their gut microbiome, which can lead to an increase in inflammation and a decrease in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin.Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood and behavior, and an imbalance in its production can lead to anxiety and depression. Additionally, the gut microbiome is responsible for the production of GABA, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in reducing anxiety.The link between gut health and depressionDepression is another common mental health disorder that is often linked to gut health. Like anxiety, depression is a complex condition with numerous contributing factors. However, research has shown that an imbalance in the gut microbiome can play a significant role in its development.Studies have found that people with depression often have a lower diversity of gut bacteria, which can lead to inflammation and a decrease in the production of neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine. Additionally, an imbalance in the gut microbiome can lead to an increase in the production of stress hormones such as cortisol, which can further contribute to depression.The role of diet in gut health and mental healthDiet plays a vital role in maintaining gut health and can have a significant impact on mental health. A diet that is high in processed foods, sugar, and unhealthy fats can lead to an imbalance in the gut microbiome and an increase in inflammation. On the other hand, a diet that is rich in whole foods, fiber, and healthy fats can help to promote a healthy gut microbiome and reduce inflammation.Gut-friendly foods to improve mental healthThe following foods are excellent for promoting gut health and improving mental health:Fermented foods such as yogurt, kefir, and kimchi, which are rich in probioticsPrebiotic foods such as garlic, onions, and asparagus, which help to feed the good bacteria in the gutFiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which help to promote a healthy gut microbiomeOmega-3 rich foods such as fatty fish, nuts, and seeds, which can help to reduce inflammation and promote healthy brain functionProbiotics and their impact on mental healthProbiotics are live microorganisms that can help to promote a healthy gut microbiome. Studies have shown that taking probiotics can help to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Additionally, probiotics can help to reduce inflammation, which is a known contributor to mental health issues.Lifestyle changes to improve gut health and mental healthIn addition to diet and probiotics, there are several lifestyle changes that people can make to promote gut health and improve mental health. These include:Reducing stress through practices such as meditation, yoga, and deep breathingGetting regular exercise, which can help to reduce inflammation and promote a healthy gut microbiomeGetting enough sleep, which is crucial for both gut health and mental healthAvoiding antibiotics unless absolutely necessary, as they can disrupt the gut microbiomeAvoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, which can disrupt gut healthConclusion: Taking care of your gut for better mental healthIn conclusion, the gut-brain connection is a fascinating and complex system that plays a crucial role in mental health. Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome through diet, probiotics, and lifestyle changes can help to reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression and promote better overall mental health. By taking care of your gut, you can take care of your mind.  If you’re struggling with anxiety or depression, take a look at your gut health. Making changes to your diet and lifestyle can have a significant impact on your mental health. Additionally, consider taking a probiotic supplement to help promote a healthy gut microbiome. Remember, taking care of your gut is crucial for taking care of your mind.","anxiety, depression, food microbiology, gut health, gut microbiome, gut microflora, gut-brain axis, mental health, probiotics"
Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, probiotics-and-gut-health",Benefits of bifidobacteria,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/benefits-of-bifidobacteria/,"March 22, 2023","Bifidobacteria are a group of Gram-positive, anaerobic, and non-motile bacteria that are commonly found in the human gastrointestinal tract. These are some important cellular and colonial characteristics, plus typical requirements for growth.Cellular characteristics:Bifidobacteria are rod-shaped bacteria with a length of 2-3 µm and a width of 0.5-1 µm.They are non-spore-forming and non-flagellated.They have a thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell wall and lack an outer membrane.They are able to ferment carbohydrates and produce lactic acid, acetic acid, and other organic acids.Colony characteristics:Bifidobacteria form white or cream-colored colonies on agar plates.The colonies are typically small (0.5-1.0 mm in diameter) and convex with a smooth surface.Bifidobacteria colonies are often surrounded by a clear zone of inhibition due to the production of organic acids that inhibit the growth of other bacteria.Growth requirements:Bifidobacteria are obligate anaerobes, meaning they require an oxygen-free environment to grow.They grow best at a pH of 6.0-7.0 and at a temperature of 37 °C.Bifidobacteria are fastidious bacteria and require a complex medium containing a variety of nutrients such as amino acids, vitamins, and minerals to grow.They are able to utilize a wide range of carbohydrates, including lactose, fructose, and oligosaccharides.There are more than 50 known species of bifidobacteria, but some of the most common and well-studied species include:Bifidobacterium adolescentis… from the human large intestine, and is known for its ability to break down complex carbohydrates.Bifidobacterium animalis… from intestinal tracts of animals, but can also be found in human faeces. It has been shown to have probiotic properties and is used in many commercial probiotic products.Bifidobacterium bifidum… from the human large intestine and is one of the first bacteria to colonise the gut of infants. It has been shown to have beneficial effects on the immune system and may help prevent gastrointestinal infections.Bifidobacterium breve… from human milk and has been shown to be beneficial for the health of infants. It has also been shown to have probiotic properties in adults.Bifidobacterium lactis… from dairy products and is used in many commercial probiotic products. It has been shown to have beneficial effects on the immune system and may help alleviate symptoms of lactose intolerance.Bifidobacterium longum… from the human gastrointestinal tract and has been shown to have probiotic properties. It may help improve gut health and alleviate symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome.Figure 1:B. longumsubsp.longum… colonial morphology (A), cellular morphology (B) and SEM image (C) – image source: Zhao et al. (2021) in Frontiers of Microbiology 12:756519.Several species of bifidobacteria are commonly used as probiotics in food and supplements, including:Bifidobacterium bifidum(Figure 2)Bifidobacterium lactisBifidobacterium longum(Figure 1)Bifidobacterium animalissubsp.lactisBifidobacterium breveBifidobacterium infantisFigure 2: SEM image ofB. bifidum– image source: Ali et al. (2015) in the Iranian Journal of Pharmaceutical Research 13:843.These species have been shown to have probiotic properties and may help support digestive health, boost the immune system, and alleviate certain gastrointestinal conditions. However, the effectiveness of specific strains and doses of bifidobacteria as probiotics may vary depending on the individual and the specific health condition being targeted.  Here are some of the potential human health benefits of bifidobacteria:Digestive health: Maintain digestive health by producing enzymes that help break down complex carbohydrates, and by producing lactic acid and other compounds that help create a favorable environment for beneficial bacteria to thrive.Immune system support: Modulate the immune system, potentially reducing the risk of allergies, infections, and autoimmune diseases.Mental health: Produce neurotransmitters such as 4-aminobutanoic acid (commonly referred to as GABA) and serotonin, which can help regulate mood and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression.Metabolic health: Improve insulin sensitivity, reduce inflammation, and improve lipid profiles, potentially reducing the risk of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes.Infant health: Bifidobacteria are among the first bacteria to colonize the gut of infants, and have been shown to play a key role in promoting healthy development of the immune system, digestive system, and brain.There’s no doubt that bifidobacteria are important members of the human gut microbiota, and they have been associated with a number of digestive health benefits. Bifidobacteria may also help reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea associated with antibiotic use, as demonstrated in a randomized controlled trial (Szajewska, Kołodziej, & Gieruszczak-Białek, 2015).We may not think of gut microbiota as playing a role in mental health, but indeed they do.  It is understood that bifidobacteria may regulate mood and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression by producing certain neurotransmitters, such as GABA and serotonin.  For example, it’s been found thatBifidobacterium infantisadministration to rats resulted in increased GABA receptor expression in the brain, leading to a reduction in anxiety-like behavior (Bravo et al., 2011). In humans, results from a randomized controlled trial were that administration of a probiotic mixture containingBifidobacterium bifidum,Bifidobacterium lactis, andLactobacillus acidophilusfor four weeks significantly reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety compared to placebo (Messaoudi et al., 2011a). In another study, the results indicated that administration of a probiotic containingBifidobacterium longumandLactobacillus helveticusfor eight weeks improved mood and cognitive function in healthy volunteers (Messaoudi et al., 2011b).References:Bravo, J.

Probiotics and gut health,prebiotics,Hemp and it’s prebiotic role,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/hemp-and-its-prebiotic-role/,"March 6, 2023","Hemp is a variety of theCannabis sativaplant species that is grown specifically for industrial use.  It is known for its strong fibers, which are used to make products such as rope, clothing, and paper, as well as its seeds, which are a source of food and oil.  Hemp contains very low levels of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive compound that causes a “high.” By law, hemp plants must contain less than 0.3% THC content on a dry weight basis in order to be considered hemp, rather than marijuana.This low level of THC in hemp makes it unlikely to produce any psychoactive effects when consumed, even in large quantities. However, it is important to note that some hemp-derived products, such as full-spectrum hemp extract, may contain trace amounts of THC and may cause a positive drug test result.It is a versatile plant that offers many potential benefits, including:Nutritional value: Hemp seeds are a good source of protein, healthy fats, fiber, and a range of vitamins and minerals, including magnesium, potassium, and iron.Environmentally friendly: Hemp is a highly sustainable crop that requires very little water and pesticides, and has the potential to improve soil health.Industrial uses: Hemp fibers can be used to make a wide range of products, including paper, clothing, and building materials, and can be a more environmentally friendly alternative to traditional materials.Health benefits: Hemp seeds and oil have been shown to have potential health benefits, including improving heart health, reducing inflammation, and reducing symptoms of certain skin conditions.Legalization: The legalization of hemp in many countries has created new opportunities for research, development, and commercialization of hemp-based products.Hemp is considered a good source of prebiotics because it contains high amounts of soluble fiber, particularly beta-glucans, which serve as food for the beneficial bacteria in the gut. This type of fiber is not digested by the human body, but instead ferments in the gut, providing fuel for the growth and activity of the gut microbiome.Studies have shown that hemp seeds and their derived products, such as hemp flour, hemp protein, and hemp oil, contain prebiotic fiber that can help to improve gut health, boost immunity, and support digestive function. Additionally, hemp seeds are a rich source of polyunsaturated fatty acids, which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and may help to reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases.In conclusion, hemp is a good source of prebiotics because of its high fiber content, which provides nourishment for the gut microbiome, and its potential health benefits, such as improved gut health, enhanced immune function, and reduced inflammation.Beta-glucans are complex sugars (polysaccharides) found in the cell walls of certain plants, fungi, and bacteria. They are best known for their health benefits, particularly in the area of immune function.In the human body, beta-glucans are recognised as foreign substances by immune cells and stimulate an immune response. This immune activation can help to improve the body’s ability to fight off infections, reduce inflammation, and lower the risk of certain chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer.Beta-glucans are commonly found in foods such as whole grains, mushrooms, and some types of seaweed. They are also available as dietary supplements. It is important to note that not all beta-glucans have the same effects, as the structure and type of beta-glucan can impact its biological activity.The specific type of hemp product with the highest amount of beta-glucans will depend on various factors such as the strain of hemp and the part of the plant that is used.In general, whole hemp seeds and their derived products, such as hemp flour and hemp protein, are considered good sources of beta-glucans. In these products, the beta-glucans are found in the seed coat and the pericarp, which are the outer layers of the seed.Hemp oil, on the other hand, is typically low in beta-glucans as they are removed during the oil extraction process.It is also important to note that the beta-glucan content of hemp products can vary greatly depending on the processing methods and conditions used, as well as other factors such as the growing conditions and maturity of the plant.In conclusion, whole hemp seeds and their derived products, such as hemp flour and hemp protein, are the types of hemp products that are likely to have the highest levels of beta-glucans. However, the actual content of beta-glucans can vary greatly and should be confirmed through lab analysis or product labeling.The amount of beta-glucan in hemp milk can vary greatly depending on the brand and formulation. Some hemp milks may contain only trace amounts of beta-glucan, while others may contain higher levels.The beta-glucan content of hemp milk is influenced by several factors, including the type of hemp used, the processing methods, and the other ingredients added to the milk. For example, some brands may use whole hemp seeds, which are a good source of beta-glucan, while others may use hemp protein isolate, which may have a lower beta-glucan content.It is best to check the label or contact the manufacturer to determine the exact beta-glucan content of a specific brand of hemp milk. In general, however, it is safe to say that hemp milk is a source of beta-glucan and can be a good way to increase your intake of this beneficial soluble fiber.","beta glucan, cannabis, food microbiology, food science, hemp"
Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health",Prebiotics and your gut microflora,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prebiotics-and-your-gut-microflora/,"February 10, 2023","The gut microflora is a diverse community of microorganisms that live in the gastrointestinal tract. It is composed of a variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms. The most prevalent and well-studied bacteria in the gut microflora are from the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes.Examples of bacteria in the gut microflora include:Bifidobacterium: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut and is thought to have a number of health benefits, including improved digestion, a stronger immune system, and a reduced risk of certain diseases.Lactobacillus: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in fermented foods such as yogurt and kefir, and is also used as a probiotic supplement.Escherichia coli(E. coli): a type of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut and is important for maintaining a healthy gut microflora. Some strains ofE. coliare beneficial, while others can cause infections.Clostridium: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut, and is important for the digestion of carbohydrates.Bacteroides: a genus of bacteria that is commonly found in the human gut, and is important for breaking down complex carbohydrates and proteins.It’s important to note that the gut microflora is a complex ecosystem and the number and type of bacteria present can vary greatly depending on factors such as diet, age, genetics, and overall health.Probiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits when consumed. The concept of using live microorganisms to promote health dates back to the early 20th century, when the Russian scientist Elie Metchnikoff observed that certain rural populations had longer lifespans and less incidence of disease than urban populations. He attributed this to their consumption of fermented dairy products, which he believed contained beneficial microorganisms. In the decades that followed, researchers began to isolate and study specific strains of microorganisms that they believed to have health benefits, leading to the development of probiotic supplements and products. Today, probiotics are available in a wide variety of forms, including capsules, tablets, powders, and fermented foods.Prebiotics are non-digestible carbohydrates that promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the gut. They act as food for probiotics, helping to increase their numbers and improve their function.Examples of prebiotics include:Inulin: a type of fructan found in many fruits and vegetables, including onions, garlic, leeks, and asparagus.Oligosaccharides: a group of carbohydrates that includes fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and galactooligosaccharides (GOS). These can be found in a variety of foods, such as chicory root, Jerusalem artichokes, and soybeans.Resistant starches: a type of starch that is not broken down and absorbed in the small intestine, but instead reaches the large intestine where it can be fermented by gut bacteria. Examples include potatoes, green bananas, and legumes.Lactose: a sugar found in milk and dairy products, which is fermented by gut bacteria.Prebiotics are often added to food products such as yogurt, cereal, and energy bars, as well as supplements. They can also be found naturally in many fruits, vegetables and whole grains.Prebiotics are important for probiotic bacteria and the gut microflora because they provide a source of energy and nutrients that the beneficial microorganisms can use to grow and thrive. When prebiotics reach the large intestine, they are fermented by the gut bacteria, which produces short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as acetate, propionate and butyrate that are essential for gut health.Prebiotics also help to promote a diverse and balanced gut microflora, which is important for maintaining gut health. A diverse gut microflora is associated with a healthy immune system, better nutrient absorption, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease.Additionally, prebiotics can improve the function of probiotics by helping to protect them from being broken down by stomach acid and bile, and also by providing an environment that supports their growth and survival.In summary, prebiotics play a crucial role in maintaining a healthy gut by providing a food source for beneficial gut bacteria, promoting diversity and balance of gut microflora, and protecting probiotic bacteria from degradation.The recommended daily intake of prebiotics varies depending on the specific type of prebiotic and the individual’s health status. However, a general guideline is to consume between 5-10 grams of prebiotics per day.It is also important to note that it is not necessary to consume prebiotics in the form of supplements, as they can be found naturally in many fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Examples of prebiotic-rich foods include:Jerusalem artichokesDandelion greensGarlicOnionsLeeksAsparagusBananas (ripe)Whole wheatBarleyOatsApplesBerriesIt is also important to note that it is best to consume a variety of prebiotic-rich foods to ensure that you are getting a diverse range of prebiotics to promote a diverse and balanced gut microflora.It is also worth noting that consuming too much prebiotics can cause digestive discomfort such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea. It’s best to start with small amounts and gradually increase the intake to see how your body reacts. Additionally, if you have any specific health conditions, it’s best to consult with a health professional before increasing your prebiotic intake.","food microbiology, food science, gut health, gut microflora, probiotics"
Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, fermented-foods, prebiotics, probiotics-and-gut-health","Prebiotics, probiotics and fermented foods",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prebiotics-probiotics-and-fermented-foods/,"August 27, 2022","After a four month break, we are back in the blogosphere!At some stage in the future, we plan to run a three-part webinar series on prebiotic, probiotics and fermented foods.  It’s like to be three monthly webinars, possibly over the Southern Hemisphere summer months of December, January and February.  If not the coming summer of 22/23, then quite likely the next summer of 23/24.Prebiotics, probiotics and fermented foods – they are separate and distinct, yet very much related, how so?  To get the most benefit from these three, it is essential to be clear on what they are, how they are similar, related and different.  Plus, how they relate to the other aspects of digestive or gut health as well as the gut microbiota, our microbiome altogether and indeed an appreciation, or at minimum, an acknowledgement or the wide-ranging influence the our gut health has on our overall and specific health and physiology.  While fermented foods date to antiquity, probiotics are a more recent concept, but are still certainly not new.  It really is just that they are returning to the fore, due to a heightened focus, not just on healthy eating and wellness, but on more natural approaches to maintaining a healthy homeostatic balance.  The immune system is a big topic at the moment, and our gut microbiota play a key immunomodulatory effect, in a very natural way.  How so and what can we do to maintain ourselves in top health by looking after our gut health?Well, probiotics are added ‘good’ and ‘friendly’ bacteria that are recognised, such as thorough clinical trials, to have a positive impact on the health of the person ingesting them.  Really though, probiotics could be thought of as a supplement, and shouldn’t really be necessary if you are looking after your natural and existing gut microbiome.  That’s where probiotics and fermented foods come in.  Prebiotics are really the nutrients that these gut bacteria require.  Various fibres that they thrive on, examples of which are inulin and especially the oligosaccharides known as GOS (galactic-oligosaccharides) and FOS (fructo-oligosaccharides).  These, and other prebiotic fibres, when consumed in appropriate quantities, should be able to sufficiently nourish your existing got microbiota.  This is the most natural approach, the simplest approach, and the ideal from the nutritional perspective too.  However, there might be times when your normal gut microbiome, which remember, can have an impact on various different parts of your body, might be negatively impacted by a range of circumstances.  These could include stress, a poor diet (or lifestyle overall) and/or taking of antibiotics.  Antibiotics in particular are bad news for your ‘friendly bacteria’ – once your antibiotics kill some of them off, your natural balance is disrupted and worst case scenario, the way is left open for invading pathogenic bacteria to establish.  Remember that your body constantly being challenged, whether it is by cancer cells or invading viruses, bacteria or other microorganisms.  Thus, with an out of balance gut microbial ecosystem, it’s only a matter of time that you become sick from the constant challenges of invading microorganisms.Under such circumstances, probiotics can be useful, either in foods, which may or may not be fermented, or as dietary supplements, like capsules and the like.  However, the best way to externally restore your gut microbial balance is with probiotic foods, which may or may not be fermented.  This is an important, really essential piece of understanding to gain here, which is – fermented foods are always going to be produced by microorganisms, because this is the nature of fermentation, it is a microbial process.  However, those fermented foods may or may not contain probiotics, even if the starter culture microorganisms are still present.  On the other hand, probiotic foods may or may not be fermented.  Today, there are many new and innovative probiotic food products that contain probiotics that are not fermented.  These have a range of probiotics added to them, essentially they are food additives.  A classic example is kombucha, the very popular and trending low to non-alcohol fermented beverage.  The natural fermenting starter cultures in kombucha are acetic acid bacteria.  Acetic acid bacteria do a fabulous job of fermenting sugars into acetic acid during the manufacturing process of kombucha.  While they are perfectly suited to fermentation in this context, they are not probiotic bacteria and will do nothing to improve the gut health or any other aspects of health, of the host.  Then, you might be asking, but I drink probiotic kombucha, it says probiotic on the label and it is a fermented drink.  Yes it is a fermented drink and yes it may be probiotic, but the two are unrelated.  This means that probiotics are added to kombucha.  The fermenting starter acetic acid bacteria cultures may or may not be present when you consume the drink, but it is irrelevant because they are not probiotics.We given an extremely brief overview here, but tried to convey the important consumer-related aspect of the difference and relatedness between probiotics foods/drinks and fermented foods/drinks, and how they are the same and different.","food microbiology, gut health, microbiology, probiotics"
Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Prospective probiotic food alternatives,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/prospective-probiotic-food-alternatives/,"March 12, 2022","Probiotics, digestive health and the gut microbiota are absolutely essential to health and wellness.  They really are cornerstones to maintaining a steady state of physical and mental health.  While this aspect may not always have been known, the benefits of fermented foods in general has been long known.  It’s always important to point out the distinction between probiotic foods and fermented foods.  A food can be probiotic, but not fermented food.  This would be when probiotics are added.  On the other hand, we can have a fermented food that is not (naturally) probiotic.  An example is kombucha.  Of course there are some foods which are fermented and probiotic, where they microorganisms that engage in the fermentation process, also provide health benefits to the host.  Foods for delivery of probiotics is so, so important.  This of course changes from country to country, and region to region, depending on the local palate and seasonality, for example.  This piece on the types of probiotic foods, as alternatives to the traditional probiotic foods of yogurt and kimchi for example, was written by Amy Tsang in 2008, a 3rd-year food science student at RMIT University.  While it is not an up-to-date account of probiotic food innovations, the ideas may stimulate thinking for your own new probiotic food development project.It is quite challenging to develop palatable and socially acceptable probiotic products for consumption, especially for non-dairy probiotic foods due to the bacteria’s sensitive character towards processing methods. Successfully manufacturing non dairy probiotics can be highly reliant upon the food matrix, these factors can consist of; pH level, storage temperature, oxygen levels and presence of competing organisms and inhibitors (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002). As cited in (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002) a method to overcome probiotic instability in non-dairy probiotics, is to introduce a method referred to as probiotic encapsulation technology. This method although successful in promoting stability of probiotic bacteria in non-dairy products; it was not utilized in any of the research papers analysed below, however the method was mentioned by (Yoon et. al, 2006).Probiotic products should be made available to suit all diets; vegetarians and consumers who suffer from diseases and allergies. As cited in (Heenan et. al, 2004) “probiotics are usually marketed in the form of fermented milks and yoghurts; however, with an increase in consumer vegetarianism throughout the country, there is a demand for vegetarian probiotic products.”The criteria for vegetarian probiotic products is simple, no animal-derived ingredients are to be used in the production process. According to (Heenan, et. al, 2004) this also applies to the media used to culture the probiotic organisms, and any ingredients used for preservation or storage. A study conducted by (Heenan, et. al, 2004) looked into a non- fermented vegetarian frozen soy dessert, and analysed the survival of probiotic organisms and sensory differences over a 6 month period. The study found that many of the probiotic bacteria such asLactobacillus acidophilus,L. rhamnosisandBifidobacterium lactissurvived the frozen conditions quite well and the numbers of viable cells were still above the minimum requirement of 107cfu/g. As for the sensory attributes, the soy- based dessert containingL. acidophilusdeveloped off-flavours (Heenan et. al, 2004).Another example of a non-dairy probiotic product is the development of a new oat-based probiotic drink, in this study (Angelov et. al, 2006) have attempted to develop a symbiotic drink derived from whole grain oat substrate and probiotic starter culture. This drink combines a good source of beta-glucan (functional constituent of cereal fibers) with probiotic cultures (Angelov et. al, 2006), because oats have a low glycemic index, this drink may be beneficial to patients who suffer from diabetes.Another probiotic alternative was under evaluation;B. brevestrain Yakult in fermented soymilk, this study focused on the capability ofB. brevestrain Yakult to grow in fermented soymilk and investigated the vivo recovery of the administered strain from faeces (Shimakawa et. al, 2003). The results for this investigation revealed that theB. brevestrain Yakult was present in high numbers after consumption; through faecal recovery. It was stated that:” the fermented soy-milk would be an excellent vehicle for live Bifidobacterium” (Shimakawa et. al, 2003, discussion section).Red beets were also analysed as a substrate for the creation of beet juice by four species of lactic acid bacteria;Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus plantarum(Yoon et. al, 2005). The results concluded that large beets could be used to produce beet juice by lactic acid fermentation withL. acidophilusorL. plantarum(Yoon, et. al, 2005). In addition to beet juice, cabbage juice was also investigated; the completed results concluded thatL. plantarumandL. delbrueckiicould be used as probiotic cultures, furthermore emphasise was placed cabbage juice as a healthy alternative for vegetarians and consumers who were allergic to lactose present in dairy products (Yoon, et. al, 2006).ReferencesAngelov, A., Gotcheva, V., Kuncheva, R., Hristozova, T., 2006, ‘Development of a new oat-based probiotic drink,’International Journal of Food Microbiology,vol. 112, pp.75-80.Heenan., C.

into the concerns of antibiotic use for our own personal health…Another important problem is associated with our own microbiome, primarily our gut microbiome, since many antibiotics are taken orally.  Unfortunately, a substantial number of antibiotics are prescribed rapidly and without reference to any antimicrobial sensitivity testing.  Under such circumstances, patients almost demand an antibiotic prescription after visiting a clinician.  The medico, under this kind of pressure from their patient, doesn’t have the time to wait up to 48 hours (or longer) for an antimicrobial sensitivity test result, typically doesn’t even request a sample, rather, prescribes a broad spectrum antibiotic, often based on nothing more than clinical observation and possible symptom history, which may be sometimes unreliable.  While this is a quick and easy way to satisfy a patient, it is harmful in multiple ways.  For example, indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics will contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes during active infections and among human and environmental reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria.  Furthermore, the patient will be unaware that taking a broad spectrum antibiotic may or may not eliminate the bacteria troubling them, but even if it does, it is highly likely to do untold damage to the host’s own flora, their microbial ecosystem.  This could open the patient up to side effects or additional infections, once the protection, primarily from the gut microbiota is severely disrupted.  Severely disrupted to the stage where opportunistic pathogenic bacteria could gain a ‘foothold’, resulting in an additional and subsequent infection(s).  So, indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics is certainly highly likely to do more harm (in the longer term) than good (n the shorter term).The way microorganisms can potentially address this, while largely unknown, would surely lie within the immense unknown prokaryotic diversity that remains to be discovered.  A few years ago,Locey and Lennon (2016)provided an updated estimation of the total prokaryotic species on our planet, which they said, is likely to be in excess of one trillion.  We currently are aware of an absolute minuscule proportion of this estimated total.  Therefore, simply by intensifying research investigations of extreme environments for yet-to-be discovered microbes and developing means to actually culture them, is likely to hold a key to humanity’s success.  Just through a trial and error investigation of the microbial world, we are highly likely to unlock some prokaryotic secrets that could hold value in addressing our global challenges.  Really, it could very well be a numbers game – with so many undiscovered species and undiscovered potential, the answers are likely to be there, if we look long and hard enough.  An important element of this though is keeping an open mind.  Keeping an open mind with regard to what we are looking for, where we look for it, how we look for it, how they are cultured and more.  If we don’t, we could very well miss the opportunity of a lifetime to change the course of humanity.  It takes sharpness, alertness and looking at situations from a different perspective to be able to recognise potential.  IfAlexander Fleming hadn’t noticed on 28 September 1928that a contaminating mould was inhibiting the growth of an important human pathogenic bacterium, the world would be a different place today.  He could have easily seen the contaminating mould on that agar plate, thrown it away, and an opportunity to change the course of humanity would have been lost.Scouring the unexplored microbial world for compounds of potential use which can be used to address human challenges is one aspect, and a key area where global efforts should be directed.  However, as old as fermented foods and probiotics are, they hold much potential to further address issues of public health associated with diet, which really, is the cornerstone to good health of everyone.  Even though each of us contain untold diversity in our own microbiome, it is still not well understood.  Innovative analytical methods are needed to improve characterisation of the human microbiome.  Furthermore, the way it is linked to a range of elements and indicators of health needs to be elucidated.  This could result in targeted food product development activities and direct public health messages, based on sound science, around what will be beneficial for health within the context of today’s lifestyle.  Furthermore, fermented foods are trending and this trend and positive image by consumers should be explored further to produce diverse fermented foods that are able to bring great public health benefits while satisfying people’s increasing desire for exotic tastes with new foods.  There are countless microorganisms of fermentative potential, and numerous types of food substrates that could be used to develop a wide range of natural and healthy foods. Consumers’ positivity towards fermented foods and beverages should really be explored further to bring them products likely to gain rapid market acceptance.  The idea is that with improved public health from improved personal health resulting from healthier eating of diverse food products of microbial origin, there would be less reliance on antibiotics.","agriculture, antibiotic resistance, food microbiology, human medicine, microbiology, probiotics, veterinary medicine"

Probiotics and gut health,"immunity, prebiotics",Why you should include prebiotics in your diet?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/why-you-should-include-prebiotics-in-your-diet/,"June 3, 2021","Though the benefits of probiotics have been studied for almost a century, only recently have their use skyrocketed, partly owing to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Even if you are not currently consuming probiotics, chances are the thought might have crossed your mind at least once. After all, the current health food buzzword is probiotics, and so many people seem to be consuming them. Be it the ever-simple yogurt or drinks like Yakult or even probiotic capsules, the benefits advertised are many-fold, and one should incorporate them in some form in their diet, especially if experiencing gut health issues (Fig 1).Fig 1: Health benefits of probioticsHowever, as you begin a journey on improving your gut health, focusing on bothprebioticsand probiotics can have compounded benefits when compared to your probiotic regimen alone. Well, what are prebiotics and what do they do?Fig 2: Foods rich in prebiotic fibresPrebiotics are defined as fermented short chain oligosaccharides, or fibres, that enhance the activity of our intestinal micro-flora. Simply put, prebiotics are “good food” for your intestinal bacteria and help them to produce functional metabolites, that improve our bodily health. To be functional, a prebiotic must be resistant to colonic digestion by the host while undergoing fermentation by the intestinal microbiota. Applying this definition, there are several digestive fibers which can be utilised as prebiotics. Generally, these include resistant starch, fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and several non-starch polysaccharides. These undergo fermentation and ultimately get released as short chain fatty acids or SCFAs, which aid in several physiological functions of our body.Now that we know their benefit, one can obtain their prebiotics naturally, from several foods, including chicory root, artichokes, garlic, onion, and cereals such as wheat, barley and millet (Fig 2). If you already have a diet rich in fiber, you can start adding probiotic foods, and vice versa if you already consume probiotics. Either way, it is imperative to modify your diet to add more fiber to have a healthy gut. You will have small issues like bloating, flatulence, or other disorders when you practice a poor diet  – constituting less fibre intake – and if continued long term, it can become chronic and may even lead to inflammatory diseases like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colitis, persistent diarrhea and other gastrointestinal conditions.BENEFITSFig 3: Mechanism of action of probiotics and prebioticsIt has been demonstrated that our gut is connected to our brain through a network of millions of neurons, and bidirectional signals between the brain and our gut through the vagus nerve can alter the GI tract’s sensory and motor function whilst impacting our brain functions too. Our enteric nervous system (ENS) regulates our gut function through peristalsis, absorption, and secretion, while our autonomic nervous system (ANS) does the same using the central nervous system (CNS), by controlling digestion, bile secretion, mucus levels and more. As mentioned earlier, SCFAs produced from the fermentation of prebiotics are absorbed into our blood circulation, and reach various tissues, including our brain where they play a pivotal role in regulating our neurological functions. Several mice model studies have confirmed that the SCFAs play a role in ENS homeostasis, stress alleviation, and promote regularity of our neural systems (Everard et al, 2011; Savignac et al, 2015; Burokas et al, 2017). Additionally, some prebiotics are known to increase our native gut microbiome proliferation, promote anti-inflammation, and reducing anxiety-like behaviors signaling a direct effect on our brain function trough the gut-brain axis. However, it’s not just the nervous system that is the point of action for the prebiotics. As you build up your fiber intake, the accretion of the chewing time in the oral cavity can promote saliva and gastric acid production, which also contributes towards higher satiety (Parnell et al, 2006). This also affects our insulin, and ghrelin (hunger hormones) secretions, eventually regulating our food intake and promoting satiation (van der beek et al, 2018). However, the most interesting claim for prebiotic intake is the supposed health implications on our gut immunity. One may be confused about the term “gut immunity”, and rightly so. Though it is well known that our immune system is composed of several barriers, our gut encounters the majority of antigens, and any immunogenic compromise can have adverse health effects almost immediately. So, it is no surprise that the major player in our immune system is located in our gastrointestinal tract – gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). GALT induces immune reaction by activating T cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and mast cells in response to pathogenic entry and prebiotics can enhance our GALT’s action. SCFAs are known to reduce the occurrence of colon cancer, colitis, and may also inhibit colonization of pathogenic bacteria to our epithelial lining through anti-inflammatory pathways (Komiyama et al, 2011; Rivera-Huerta et al, 2017; Rani et al, 2019). Among other functions, SCFAs also act as signaling factors and increase the production of regulatory T cells, improving our gut immunity (Freitas et al, 2014). SCFAs produced by our gut microbiome also increase calcium bioavailability, thereby increasing our bone density and improving iron absorption. Epidemiological research has also suggested a link between a low prebiotic diet and cardiovascular diseases (Kochar et al, 2007; Tang et al, 2019). SCFAs alter lipid metabolism, and possibly lower your risk for heart diseases, by reducing the LDL cholesterol serum concentrations. Overall, the promising benefits of prebiotics promote them as a powerful tool for altering your microbial composition and to strengthen your immunity.REFERENCESBurokas, Aurelijus, Arboleya, Silvia, Moloney, Rachel D, Peterson, Veronica L, Murphy, Kiera, Clarke, Gerard, Stanton, Catherine, Dinan, Timothy G, & Cryan, John F.

Probiotics and gut health,"probiotics-and-gut-health, yeast",How we address scientific challenges today,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/how-we-address-scientific-challenges-today/,"May 17, 2021","Long gone are the days when microbiologists worked in isolation and produced single-author original research papers, perhaps with the help of a technical assistant or research assistant.  Not only are demands on researchers seemingly greater than they were 100+ years ago, but research today is vastly different from what it was.  Multidisciplinary teams and Interdisciplinary research is the norm, and were not just talking about a team of microbiologists with different interests and different specialties, no I’m talking of teams spanning diverse disciplines in science, and even non-science, sometimes geographically separated by thousands of kilometres and multiple timezones.  Take for example, a project team I was part of at RMIT University several years ago – despite being a food microbiologist, I held a position in the School of Business IT and Logistics, where I worked (in the one project!) with e-commerce and innovative retailing experts, information systems professionals and environmental scientists trained in life cycle analysis (Figure 1).Fig. 1How are we leveraging the diverse expertise across different disciplines’ cross industry and academic 9and private research organisations) and breaking geographical barriers along with cross-cultural differences to advance science, and indeed society.  Really, that is all part of modern day science, and why diverse networking is an essential element of modern research and development pursuits.Another example I want to offer is my postdoctoral work, carried out in the School of Applied Sciences at RMIT University.  While we were all food scientists, I was a food microbiologist working in the Food Chemistry research group on projects in the area of physical chemistry and materials science, with experts in the area of rheology and calorimetric properties of food ingredients.  What might be the connection you may say, between food microbiology and materials science?  In this day and age, almost any discipline has an overlap and influence with another discipline, when talking of applied science and applied research as opposed to basic and fundamental science – which still may diversely multidisciplinary.Let me explain one example of a food scientist working at the interface of microbiology, physical chemistry and materials science.  One’s microbiome is an essential microbial ecosystem unique to the individual that functions in maintaining balance, not only in relation to guy or digestive health, but in other body systems too, even mental health as we are not coming to understand.  As a result of a range of factors, such as antibiotic-based abuse of our microbiome, our body’s microbial ecosystem may get out of balance, resulting in health disruptions, such as the rise and dominance of a pathogenic microorganism, no longer kept in check by ‘friendly’ bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract.  The area of probiotics, gut health and fermented foods is ancient, but enjoying a resurgence in popularity as people seek increasing natural ways to restore and maintain their health.  A traditional approach to restoring the gut bacterial balance is through probiotics consumed in food products, traditionally dairy products.  However, many issues have been raised with survival and the maintenance of viability of probiotic microorganisms in the sometimes harsh conditions found in food products (low pH), manufacturing (high temperature) and gastrointestinal passage (low pH), where sometimes, few viable cells reach the location of the gastrointestinal tract where they need to exert their effects.  While in various situations, basic studies on the microbiology of stress responses have elucidated elements of how tolerance (or lack of) to such conditions occurs, there is still a need for improved viability and survival of the diverse probiotics available, under the widely variable conditions found in products, manufacturing along with storage/distribution.  One approach that has been used in the food industry for delivery of sensitive compounds in found is encapsulation of various types, traditionally microencapsulation, but now encapsulation (Figure 2) on a nano scale – nano encapsulation.  There are many approaches with regard to encapsulation material and how the capsules are prepared that promote improved probiotic survival under different conditions.  Culture preparation is another factor that may be important in the ultimate survival of those encapsulated cells.  For example, in some circumstances, freeze dried cultures can be added to microcapsules, and perform better, with regard to tolerance to extreme environmental conditions, such as those encountered in food, during processing and in gastrointestinal passage.  To ensure that the highest concentration of viable cells possible is applied to the capsule, a cryoprotectant is typically selected that will allow the highest viability following freeze drying.  Certainly, in some cases,  forSachharomyces boulardii, this information is not known and consequently, we are likely to be missing out on maximising the effect of microencapsulation.  Thus, basic studies on cryoprotectants to determine, for example, important physical properties like the glass transition temperature (Figure 3) may be critical in advancement of this area of food science and highlights the cross disciplinary approach that can address a range of real-world problems to advance science.  Therefore, diverse networking and collaboration is essential – why not contact someone new today and expand your professional network?Fig. 2Fig. 3","food microbiology, food science, food scientist, materials science, physical chemistry, probiotics, research"
Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, food-safety, probiotics-and-gut-health, public-health",Antibiotic misuse and overuse,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/antibiotic-misuse-and-overuse/,"February 19, 2021","Antibiotics, discovered and commercially developed in the 1930s, have gone from being hailed as ‘magic bullets’ in 1940s human medical practice to nearly a scourge of humanity today, through decades of overuse and misuse in human and veterinary medicine.  As the World Health Organization states, they really do pose a big public health threat, across the world (Figure 1).  Despite being the foundation of ‘miracle’ cures in the early days, those gains in the war against human bacterial diseases are starting to unravel and are at serious risk of being reversed.  Not only that, but residual levels of antibiotics present in the food supply, resulting from widespread use in the agricultural environment has posed additional threats to human health.  These represent another facet of food safety, apart from the more common microbial food safety, which has wide-ranging public health consequences.  Seemingly, the lack of understanding around the molecular genetics of antibiotic resistance development and consumers’ comfort level with antibiotics, means that the general public appears to have very little concern for the environmental, personal health and public health consequences of antibiotic overuse and misuse.  Interestingly, the same people are quite possibly staunchly opposed to genetic modification in agriculture, which has no safety concerns, yet are comfortable with antibiotics, despite their negative impacts on the environment and on humanity.  In this article, I want to focus on the effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and the subsequent negative on that may arise for one’s personal health, which may or may not be able to be rectified through consumption of probiotic foods.  A further consequence could be increased susceptibility to foodborne disease.Figure 1: Antibiotic resistance is a significant public health issue across the planet.One’s gut microbiome, which develops shortly after birth, is a delicately balanced ecosystem of specific bacterial species characteristic of that individual.  While some generalisations can be made, the finer aspects are unique to each of us.  Overall, we still have much to learn and understand about the human gut microbiome (Iizumi, 2017).  However, what we are increasingly gaining an acknowledgement of, and indeed an appreciation for, are the diverse impacts good gut health may have for it’s host.  Conversely, the negative consequences of disruption to our specific balance of bacterial species can have serious detriment.While antibiotics are indeed ‘wonder drugs’ capable of eliminating or stopping the growth of many bacteria, there are downsides.  I’m not just talking about contribution to the devastation of antibiotic resistance prevailing in the world, or the side effects to antibiotic therapy an individual can experience, but to the disruption or sometimes decimation to one’s gut microbiome that may result during a course of antibiotics.  These are potentially big problems of a personal nature for us.It is acknowledged that the gut microbiome, and in fact our natural flora in other parts of the body, plays diverse positive roles in our personal health.  Originally this was thought to be localised, and so consumption of probiotics to ensure gut microbe balance was to have an impact on digestive health.  While this is certainly true, there’s an increasing appreciation of the wide effects.  Not only on physical health, but on mental health too – more information in thisblog articleI wrote towards the end of 2020.So with such a potential wide impact from disruption to one’s gut microbiota, how can we help our ‘friendly’ bacteria to help us?  Keeping personal antibiotic use to an absolute minimum is one way by simply saying no to antibiotics and exploring alternatives (Figure 2).  I for one, have not had to treat an infection of mine using antibiotics since 1990.  The comprehensive review paper (Ferreret al., 2017) on the topic of how the functioning of the gut microbiome is negatively impacted by antibiotic therapy reviews several studies that have demonstrated just how bad antibiotics are for our gut microbiota.  These authors cover numerous references to studies demonstrating the general reduction in total gut bacteria and also for specific taxa.  The complex diagram presented in Figure 3 shows how particular gut bacteria and negatively effected by antibiotics.  This really does highlight the magnitude of the (growing) problem around adverse effects on personal health of antibiotic therapy.Figure 2: Say NO to antibiotics.Figure 3: Complexities of how antibiotics negatively impact bacteria of the gut microbiome.  Source: Ferreret al.(2017).Despite this negativity, there are some interesting opposing results.  Martín-Núñezet al. (2019) found that the significant changes to the gut microbiota in human subjects with antibiotic therapy forHelicobacter pyloriinfection improved host glucose homeostatis.   So it’s not all doom and gloom, but that doesn’t mean we should be encouraging an imbalance of one’s gut microbiota!  Furthermore, Raymondet al. (2016) raises an interesting finding that although negative impacts to the gut microbiome composition take place, they are predictable and with knowledge of an individual’s original gut microbiome profile.Despite the above consequences in the human context, the fact remains that agricultural use of antibiotics accounts for the vast majority of antibiotic sales, in the US (Figure 4).  With the rapidly developing interest in plant-based foods, this will hopefully become less of a problem, but certainly, the absolute dominance of antibiotic use in the context of veterinary medicine as compared with human medicine, is yet another reason to consider plant-based dietary options.Figure 4: Use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine dominates over human medicine.So where does that leave us?  Antibiotics have a place, and if they are used for their intended purpose then it is unlikely we would be in the predicament we find ourselves in now.  Therefore, we all need to contribute and play our part to halt the deleterious effects on our personal health and on our public health by refusing to be part of antibiotic overuse and misuse.ReferencesFerrer, Manuel, Méndez-García, Celia, Rojo, David, Barbas, Coral, & Moya, Andrés.

Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Probiotics and their viability in foods and gastrointestinal passage.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/probiotics-and-their-viability-in-foods-and-gastrointestinal-passage/,"January 4, 2021","The text of this blog article was originally written by Amy Tsang, a 3rd-year food technology student of mine at RMIT University in 2009.  I have provided some slight updates/changes/revisions.While probiotics now exist (for example,Bacilluscoagulans) that are able to withstand pasteurisation and high pressure processing, there’s no doubt of the ongoing importance of the issue of viability of probiotics, given adequate amounts of the organisms reaching the appropriate place in the gastrointestinal tract is a requisite for their success, and the multitude of factors that can negatively impact probiotic survival during manufacture, in food and during gastrointestinal passage, as noted in the image above.Probiotics continue to attracted much interest from consumers; who are concerned with their personal diet and lifestyle. These consumers expect that the functional foods they consume will exert clear health benefits for their digestive system; especially in Europe where gut health is a key component for the benefits provided by functional foods (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002). Future research into probiotics may also help to alleviate many health issues such as allergies or even particular types of cancers. Currently there are many studies focused on probiotic survival through the gastrointestinal environment.Misconceptions about probiotics need to be defended when placed under scrutiny (Gorbach, 2002). To counter misconceptions of probiotics, detailed research and human/clinical studies need to be conducted by scientists to prove to consumers that probiotics have health promoting properties. In addition, consumer education is also important; if probiotics were to become a part of the daily diet; appropriate scientific facts and information should be made readily available for consumers. Without consumer confidence, the probiotic industry would not prosper.There are several major issues that need to be addressed before developing new probiotic products or re-formulating products for consumption.  The viability and stability of probiotics and maintaining an acceptable number of viable cells above food standard requirements throughout the whole shelf life of the product and ensuring specific probiotic strains are chosen that can withstand the gastrointestinal stresses present in that environment; these have all been major challenges for the food industry (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002). These requirements highlight the need for innovative solutions such as new technological advancements; however maintenance of low production costs will also be high on the agenda as the solutions need to be financially viable for food manufacturers and consumers alike.Yoghurt, a popular dairy product with probiotic health benefits, has established the foundations for further research into other potential probiotic functional foods such as; probiotic drinks, non dairy beverages; vegetable and fruit juices, desserts for vegetarians, baby foods, and cereal based products (Mattila-Sandholm et. al, 2002; Heenan, 2004 et. al; Prado et. al, 2008; Lee & Salminen, 1995).Various ideas towards the method of benefit offered by probiotics have been hypothesised. Although these significant methods have not been completely established, the possibilities include; rivalry for nutrients, secretion of microbial substances, blocking of adhesion sites, decrease in virulence, blocking of toxin receptor sites, immune stimulation and suppression of toxin production (Fooks et. al, 1999). The competition for nutrients is quite a significant factor for any bacteria thriving in the gastrointestinal tract. Various bacterial species are quite specific in their nutritional requirements and so one particular population may deplete nutrients at the expense of another species (Fooks et. al, 1999); thus if probiotics were used in this circumstance it would be highly beneficial to the gut flora, where health promoting bacteria may predominate. In general terms, probiotic foods and supplements are expected to restore the balance in the gut; given there are sufficient numbers, which is generally 106cfu/g (Elahi et.al, 2008; Lee & Salminen, 1996).Probiotic effectiveness can be further enhanced with the inclusion of probiotics for a symbiotic effect. According to (Fooks et. al, 1999) this combination of one probiotic with another probiotic can enhance the survival of probiotic bacteria overall.To further highlight the importance of probiotic bacterial survival, there are also other issues to consider. Although probiotic bacteria in food products may be able to survive the initial fermentation, production process; the storage and the gastrointestinal tract are also of great concern, probiotic bacteria may be susceptible to extreme and harsh environments. As discussed by (Lacroix & Yildirim, 2007) the storage conditions can have an impact on probiotic bacteria such as oxygen stress, competition with other organisms, variability in temperature and moisture content, given that the probiotic bacteria do survive during storage they are then exposed to the gastrointestinal tract.Furthermore, the gastrointestinal tract will have extreme acidic conditions present in the stomach and enzyme activity will be present, thus the composition of the environment may not favour the probiotic bacteria and presence of bile salts in the small intestine may inhibit the growth of the probiotic bacteria ingested (Lacroix & Yildirim, 2007). These are typical stresses which probiotic bacteria may be subjected to, therefore probiotic bacteria chosen for products should be those that can adapt to extreme conditions and changing environments (Lacroix & Yildirim, 2007). Therefore due to such conditions, it is not always likely that sufficient numbers of probiotic bacteria will reach the appropriate gut location to exert their beneficial health effects. A research project was conducted by (Gibson & Brostoff, 2005 – apologies, citation details cannot be found!) to test commercially available supplements that contained strains of probiotic bacteria and their survival in the gastrointestinal environment. Their results demonstrated thatLactobacillus spp.were resistant to the gastric environment, however they were sensitive to the upper intestinal content, on the contraryBifidobacterium spp.displayed sensitivity to the stomach environment but were able to survive well in the upper intestine. This study highlighted the significance of different probiotic species and their diverse capacity to survive within the intestinal environment.ReferencesElahi, S., Farnell, P., Thurlow, K.

Probiotics and gut health,"fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Probiotics and mental health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/probiotics-and-mental-health/,"December 19, 2020","Deep into the festive period now and six days to Christmas in this crazy pandemic year!  What a year it has been, exceptionally good for some, exceptionally bad for some.  For those that have done it tough, mental health issues have been prominent in issues mentioned as a consequence of this pandemic.  If you’ve still got your health and your financial stability and securing, there are certainly chances that your mental state may have been compromised during the course of this year.  Of course, this may still be the case into 2021, with ongoing uncertainty.Mental health and mental wellbeing is prominent in today’s society, at least in Australia where I am located.  It is openly seen as a key indicator of good health these days, along with the more traditional physical health metric.  Of course, spiritual health comes into it too, but for now, let us focus on mental health.While the health benefits of probiotics have been speculated/noted for an extremely long time, it has tended to focus on gut and digestive health.  This is natural, because probiotics are administered and expected to exert their benefits in the gastrointestinal tract and, for the most part, become part of the host’s gut microbiome.  While there are some probiotics that tend to be more transient in nature, such asSachharomyces boulardii, many probiotics are administered for the purpose of restoring the host’s normal flora and hence restoring digestive health.  Over the years, there has been a mind-boggling amount of research on probiotics, to the extent that some are skeptical of their benefits.  Like anything, while it is certainly true that some people tend to ‘jump the gun’ and share or promote non-evidence-based therapeutics, there is mounting evidence in many different areas for the benefits of probiotics.  One of these areas is mental health.There’s no doubt that there is a relationship between food and mood, as backed up for the academic centre of that name at Deakin University in Melbourne.  However, a resulting good mood goes beyond just eating so-called ‘comfort food’ that makes us feel better, or eating chocolate when we feel down or ‘blue’.  There is actually scientific evidence for the benefits for the benefits of probiotics and the positive effects they can have on mental health.  Remember that these probiotic foods may or may not be fermented.  With the development of processing-stable probiotics, such as a specifically developedBacillus coagulanssold by Kerry Ingredients, there are an increasing amount of non-fermented probiotic foods available today.  These are foods where the probiotic component is really a food additive, untreated to the production of the food.  They are incorporated during processing, typically earlier on, and able to withstand HTST (high temperature short time) pasteurisation and HPP (high pressure processing), which, in the case of a fermented food, would eliminate the starter culture.Treat these few paragraphs as a bit of an introduction to this fascinating area and follow the link below to my blog article on this topic which was published on the TCLH website five days ago.https://www.tclh.com.au/blog/how-to-stay-healthy-over-the-christmas-period",
Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, yeast",Kombucha is not naturally probiotic.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/kombucha-is-not-naturally-a-probiotic-product/,"November 13, 2020","This topic is in a pretty hot space, because both kombucha and probiotics are very much ‘in fashion’ and trending at the present time across the worldwide, as can be seen in the all-time Google Trends for this word which has showed a slow rise over the last seven years, peaking this year during the third week of January (Figure 1).  Leading the way in search interest on Google for “kombucha” are New Zealand, followed by Australia (Figure 2).  This shows how interest in kombucha is at an all-time high in 2020, especially in New Zealand and Australia, followed by Canada and the United States.  Google interest in “probiotics” has shown an increase ever since records began (Figure 3), with a peak at a similar time earlier this year (late January/early February).  Search interest from Australia (5th) and New Zealand (6th) still ranks highly, although the United States (2nd) and Canada (4th) rank higher, with Singapore at number three.  Perhaps surprising is Trinidad and Tobago at number one – small sample size perhaps?  In any case, kombucha and probiotics are of much interest, particularly from westernised nations of the world with advanced economies.Figure 1: Global Google Trends for “kombucha”.Figure 2: Top five countries searching for “kombucha” on Google Trends.Figure 3: Global Google Trends for “probiotic”.Figure 4: Top five countries for “probiotic” on Google Trends.This strong interest, resurgence is fascinating, given the age-old origins of both kombucha and provides, essentially stretching back millennia for kombucha in particular.  At this stage I want to introduce the distinction between probiotic foods and beverages and fermented foods and beverages.  While there is certainly overlap, in many instances, they are certainly not interchangeable terms.  Let us just consider that all foods/beverages could be categorised as:Fermented and probiotic – for example most yogurts and kimchi.Non-fermented and probiotic – for example some popcorn and some protein bars.Fermented and non-probiotic – for example natural kombucha and sourdough bread.Non-fermented and non-probiotic – for example peanut butter or ice cream.Kombucha is naturally, a fermented and non-probiotic beverage (tea) of ancient Chinese origin with consumption for “magical” properties being known from the Qin dynasty (around 220 BC) with subsequent historical consumption in China, Germany and Russia (Greenwaltet al., 2000).  However even today, despite mass consumption as a functional food for various postulated health benefits, no real evidence of any health benefits exists in the human contextin vivoalthough promising results have been seenin vitroand with animal models (Figure 5) (Moraleset al., 2020).Figure 5: Laboratory testing, animal models and human success to demonstrate health benefits of kombucha. Source: Morales et al. (2020).Kombucha is produced by what is referred to as a SCOBY, aSymbioticCultureOfBacteria andYeasts and is widely known in consumer circles as “tea fungus” (Figure).  Within this symbiotic community (Figures 6 and 7), bacterial diversity is limited to mostly species ofAcetobacterwhile a myriad of yeast species are likely to be present (Teohet al., 2004).  A detailed review by Moraleset al.(2020) has identified the following microorganism groups isolated from kombucha; 22 species of acetic acid bacteria from six genera, 3 species of lactic acid bacteria from two genera and 41 species of yeast from 21 genera –AcetobacterandGluconacetobacterare the bacterial genera with the most species isolated from kombucha whileHanseniasporaandZygosaccharomycesare the yeast genera with the most species isolated.Figure 6: An advanced fermentative state of kombucha (Source: Jayabalanet al., 2014).Figure 7: Microscopic view of SCOBY.  Source: Greenwaltet al.(2000).So, while kombucha is indeed a fermented beverage, it is not fermented with probiotic microorganisms – it is fermented with yeasts and acetic acid bacteria that do not have any demonstrated probiotic benefit.  Therefore, their only role is to turn tea into kombucha through their growth and metabolic activity, thus producing a variety of compounds in the process (Figure 8).  Thus, while you may in fact be consuming live culture in kombucha, these microorganisms that have been used to make kombucha will do little for your gut wellbeing.  From studies conducted on the microbial content of kombucha, there is admittedly some lactic acid bacteria present sometimes, however while they MAY be probiotic, they are most likely present at too low a concentration to confer any health benefit to to the host, which is of course a key element of the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of probiotics.Figure 8: How acetic acid bacteria and yeast ferment tea into kombucha.  Source: Tranet al.(2020).Manufacturers have thus sought to capitalise on the probiotic image of kombucha through the addition of probiotics to the product, that have no role in actually making the product.  This is fine, but it’s worth knowing that such probiotics are an additive because as mentioned above, they do not function in the fermentation process.  Therefore, from this perspective, kombucha has little difference from any other probiotic food or drink to which probiotics are added, to make them probiotic products, of which there are diverse types on the market these days, such as popcorn (Figure 9).Figure 9: A probiotic popcorn product on sale in a Melbourne supermarket. Photo by @pdbuttonLast point, read the science, believe the science and remember to only trust credible sources so as not to be misled by erroneous information that is more easily found online (Figure 10).  While kombucha might be delicious, they are not naturally probiotic and need to be made probiotic through the addition of probiotics (therefore, read the label and see if it is probiotic or a fermented beverage only) and there is certainly no robust evidence that kombucha has any human health benefits, despite such claims below in the popular health media online.Figure 10: An erroneous “blanket” reference to the probiotic and other health properties for all kombucha products.ReferencesGreenwalt, C.

Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",Improving the survivability of probiotic bacteria,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/improving-the-survivability-of-probiotic-bacteria/,"September 9, 2020","This article is an extract from a literature review written by Louise Sidharta, a 3rd-year undergraduate student I was supervising at RMIT University in 2009.Introductory comments by Dr Philip Button.For probiotic bacteria to exert their positive effects, they need to survive many hostile (micro)environments before they reach the location in the gastrointestinal tract where they are needed.  Food processing conditions, temperate fluctuations during the post-manufacture supply chain, intrinsic conditions in the food and the gastrointestinal tract all provide challenges.  To deliver the maximum amount of probiotics right their site of action can pose a great challenge to food microbiologists – these are some of the strategies they can employ to ensure the highest percentage of survival.  Let’s now hear from Louise…Strain selectionAs mentioned previously, the ability to survive through the acid in the human stomach and bile in the intestine is one of the most important characteristics of probiotic bacteria. A number of studies on the survival ofL. acidophilus(Figure 1) andBifidobacteriumspp. in the presence of acid and bile salts have been carried out by several investigators (Conway, Gorbach, & Goldin, 1987; Gilliland, Staley, & Bush, 1984; Holcomb, Frank, & McGregor, 1991; Ibrahim & Bezkorovainy, 1993). Clark & Martin (1994) reported thatB. longumtolerated bile concentrations of as high as 4.0%, whereas Ibrahim & Bezkorovainy (1993) foundB. longumto be the least resistant to bile. Furthermore, three out of six CSIRO strains of lactobacilli showed the best survivability under acidic conditions and two strains showed the best tolerance to bile (Lankaputhra & Shah, 1995). Therefore, careful selection of strains on the basis of acid and bile tolerance would help improve the survivabilityensure the required minimum amount of probiotic bacteria in a given product.Figure 1:Lactobacillus acidophilusTwo-step fermentationThe composition of the yoghurt cultures participating in the fermentation has been suspected postulated to affect the survival ofL. acidophilusandBifidobacteriumspp., causing their severe viability losses during storage (Shah, 2000). Inhibitory substances such as acid and hydrogen peroxide produced by yoghurt cultures are the major cause of this problem, as explained by Hull, Roberts, & Mayes (1984). Nevertheless, these cultures are prerequisite in yoghurt manufacture as they are responsible for the typical yoghurt flavour. Lankaputhra & Shah (1997) suggested two-stage fermentation as means of improving the viability of probiotic bacteria. Results from this study showed that fermentation with probiotic bacteria followed by fermentation with yoghurt cultures brings a significant increase in the initial and final counts of probiotic bacteria. The initial counts have been found to increase by 4 to 5 times and the final counts ofL. acidophilus2409 andB. longum1941 following 6 weeks of storage were 6.85 and 7.93 log cfu/g and 7.60 and 8.84 cfu/g for yoghurt prepared by single and two-stage fermentation, respectively.Oxygen impermeable packagingL. acidophilusis microaerophilic andBifidobacteriumspp. are strictly anaerobic. Oxygen affects the probiotic cultures in two ways; by direct or indirect toxicity to cells (Dave & Shah, 1997). Direct toxicity is presumably due to the intracellular production of hydrogen peroxide, while indirect toxicity is caused by the production of hydrogen peroxide by other cultures in the environment such asL. delbrueckii(Villegas & Gilliland, 1998). One way to prevent the detrimental effects of oxygen on the probiotic cultures is through the use of oxygen-impermeable packaging. Dave & Shah (1997) reported a higher increase in numbers and survival ofL. acidophilusduring storage in yoghurts made in plastic containers rather than glass. Bifidobacteria showed higher survival in glass bottles than in plastic cups. To be exact, the initial counts of the bifidobacteria population were 1.6 fold higher in yoghurt prepared in glass bottles than plastic cups, although the acid contents were similar in both samples. Klaveret al. (1993) observed better survival and viability of bifidobacteria in deaerated milk.MicroencapsulationMicroencapsulation technology has been under special consideration and investigation as an effective approach to enhance the survival rate of probiotic bacteria in acidic products (Figure 2) such as dairy fermented products (Kailasapathy, 2002; Krasaekoopt, Bhandari, & Deeth, 2003). Shahidi & Han (1993) define microencapsulation as “a technology of packaging solids, liquid or gaseous materials in miniature, sealed capsules that can release their contents at controlled rates under the influence of specific conditions”. Another definition from a microbiological point of view defines microencapsulation as “the process of entrapment/enclosure of microbial cells by means of coating them with proper hydrocolloid(s) in order to segregate the cells from the surrounding environment; in a way that results in appropriate cell release in the intestinal medium” (Sultanaet al., 2000; Krasaekooptet al., 2003; Picot & Lacroix, 2003).  Microencapsulation has been shown to protect the probiotic bacterial cells against the influences of adverse environmental factors such as high acidity and low pH (Sun & Griffiths, 2000), bile salts (Lee & Heo, 2000), cold shocks caused by deep freezing and freeze drying (Shah & Ravula, 2000), molecular oxygen in case of strictly anaerobic microorganisms likeBifidobacteriumspp. (Sunoharaet al., 1995), and heat shocks caused by spray drying (Steensonet al., 1987). According to Anal & Singh (2007), the most commonly used encapsulant materials in microencapsulation are food-grade polymers such as alginate, chitosan, κ-carrageenan and gelatin.Figure 2: How microencapsulation can help probiotic survival.ReferencesAnal, A.

A few weeks ago, I started moving our video content to our new Brand YouTube channel, with the first (and so far the only!) video on our channel being  on my career in food microbiology.  In fact, this video formed the basis of our vlog posted on May 24, which is located here:http://foodmicrobiology.academy/2020/05/24/my-food-microbiology-career/.So anyway, a few days ago my video was found by a (very) young aspiring food microbiologist in Mumbai, India.  This teenage student made some comments to initiate a conversation with my around career advice and guidance, then we continue our discussions through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.  Now, we’re about to formalise our discussions with a mentoring agreement.  This is just great news and of mutual benefit as she can clearly gain from my years on a non-traditional career path and I real feel like I’m ‘giving back’ and encouraging and ‘grooming’ the next generation of passionate food microbiologists to come along and really take on the challenges of the world and solve them, which we can all really achieve together.  This student is pretty amazing because even at her young age, she has a career vision and a firm goal of wanting to work in the area of food safety and foodborne diseases at the World Health Organization.  With such a plan at such an early age, she can so get there as well.  What I wanted this blog post to be was to introduce the career mentoring thatFood Microbiology Academynow offers by elaborating on some of the examples I provided to this mentee during our early discussions.Firstly, too many people, myself included years ago in the mid to late 1990s, have a general career idea but no firm goal and vision.  Without this, you do almost wander aimlessly to some extent.  Thus, I would say – don’t worry about or try and identify what you will study as your undergraduate degree and where until you have identified your dream job.  Then, you can work backwards.  Setting your dream job as your goal will help answer so many questions, such as:Which is the highest degree I’ll need?Do I need to do a Master degree?  if so, should it be a research or coursework Master degree?Which country should I complete my various degrees in?What should my undergraduate degree be in?What sort of opportunities should I seek during holidays or internships to support me reaching my career goal(s)?For example, if you have come to the conclusion that you need a PhD, does the Australian (three years, one laboratory, research only) or North American (four years, laboratory rotations during the first year, 25% coursework) model work better for you and your career.  Then, for training like a PhD, the importance of factors that you should consider can be ranked like this, from most important to least important: Supervisor > Laboratory > Department > University > Country.  Some people get to hung up over doing their PhD in a particular country or a particular university.  However, it is the supervisor that is most critical and I’m sure you can find exceptional academic supervisors leading world-class research groups engaging in cutting edge discoveries located in what many would consider sub-standard universities or lower ranking countries for research training or higher education in general.However, you may not even be at the stage where you can identify your ideal or dream job, but you just have a hankering for food microbiology.  In such case, perhaps consider the following, as a non-exhaustive list of careers in food microbiology that require high levels of responsibility, so senior positions that typical require a PhD:I)Teaching food microbiology in a college/university(professor in a community college).II)Doing food safety research in a university(research-only academic position, like Research Assistant Professor or Senior Research Fellow, in a research-intensive university).III)Teaching food microbiology and doing food safety research in a university(traditional academic position).IV)Doing food safety research and development in a food manufacturing company(only food manufacturing companies of substantial size, like Nestlé would engage in such R&D)V)Consulting and therefore providing advice to small and medium size food companies on keeping their products safe(either as an independent consultant or working for a scientific consulting firm).VI)Managing food safety at a large food manufacturing company(this may be part of a quality management role of if the food manufacturing operation is large enough, then it would be a seperate position).VII)Tracking foodborne diseases and identifying sources of outbreaks(such as at a government health organisation, which could be at a national level like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States or the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory in the Australian state of Victoria)VIII)Developing public health strategies and government policy to reduce foodborne disease(an advisory role in government to assemble scientific information and make recommendations for policy and legislative changes to protect the health of the citizens under the jurisdiction of the government you’re working for).So, if you’re a budding food microbiologist (no pun intended!) or simply want to find out more about careers and working in our field, do contact myself (Dr Philip Button, @pdbutton, by e-mail to philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academy).","career, career choice, food microbiologist, mentoring"
Probiotics and gut health,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, viruses",Where to obtain maximum probiotic benefits.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/where-to-obtain-maximum-probiotic-benefits/,"August 4, 2020","Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, “immune system” has been a buzzword around us! Recovery from this disease in most cases has largely been reliant on the human body’s natural defence, the immune system. A whopping 70% of our immune system activity is located in our gut. Bacteria in the intestine may help regulate immune cell activity, which allows probiotics to be potentially helpful for supporting immune function. Clinical evidence shows that certain probiotic strains help to prevent bacterial and viral infections, including gastroenteritis, sepsis, and respiratory tract infections.What are probiotics ?Probiotics are “live microorganisms  when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.” The concept of probiotic bacteria is very old, and is associated with the consumption of fermented foods by human beings, for thousands of years. Recently, new types of food products containing probiotic bacteria have started to be introduced into the market, including non-dairy products, such as chocolate, cereals, beverages, fruits and vegetables products. In the near future, a wide range of non-traditional food products containing probiotic bacteria are expected to be introduced into the market.How Probiotics Act ?As mentioned in an earlier blog article, probiotics have various mechanisms of action. Probiotic microorganisms can be elucidated by promotion of digestion and uptake of dietary nutrients, strengthening of intestinal barrier function, modulation of the innate and acquired immune response of the host, production of antimicrobial substances and competition with pathogens for binding sites. In addition probiotics show adhesion and colonization of the different sites of the human body which may increase their retention time thus providing prolonged probiotic activity.Probiotics  produce substances that inhibit pathogens – low-molecular weight substances – bacteriocins, antibiotics and microcins. Lactic acid bacteria produce a variety of substances that exhibit antagonistic activity against other bacteria.Various Probiotic ProductsDairy probiotic products:-Milk is an excellent medium to carry or generate live and active probiotics through various cultured dairy products. The buffering capacity of milk helps to improve the survival of probiotic flora in the GI tract. Currently hundreds of probiotic dairy products are manufactured and consumed around the world, examples are as follows.Yoghurt– About 80% of the population use yoghurt for direct consumption or as a food supplement daily. A characteristic feature of this product is the addition of starters of pure cultures ofStreptococcus thermophilusandLactobacillus delbrueckiissp.Bulgaricusfor conducting lactic acid fermentation.  These traditional lactic acid bacteria have a positive effect on the body, which is a result of the formed metabolites, which inhibit the putrefactive and pathogenic flora or of the improvement of the utilization of lactose. In last decade many new flavours have been incorporated in yoghurts in order to attract consumers.Ice cream– The incorporation of probiotic cultures into ice cream results in adding value to the ice cream product and it being considered as a functional product. The ice cream composition, which includes milk, incorporating proteins, fat and lactose, as well as other compounds, make ice cream a good vehicle for probiotic cultures. During probiotic ice cream development, the ultimate aim of processes optimization is to enhance and maintain the probiotic survivability, ice cream being relatively high in pH at values of 5.5 to 6.5 leads to an increased survival of the probiotic bacteria upon storage.Cheese– Cheese provides a valuable alternative as a food vehicle for probiotic delivery. Its high protein content provides probiotic bacteria with a good buffering protection against the high acidic condition in the gastrointestinal tract, and thus enhances probiotic bacterial survival throughout gastric transit. Cheddar cheese is a good carrier to deliverEnterococcus faeciuminto the gastrointestinal tract of humans.Kefir– Kefir is a traditional popular beverage consumed for thousands of years in the Central Asia and Middle East countries. It is an acidic-alcoholic fermented milk product, with uniform creamy consistency and a slight sour taste. Milk is fermented with kefir grains, it usually contain lactose-fermenting yeastsKluyveromyces lactis, K. marxianusandTorula kefir.Lactobacillus, Lactococcus,andLeuconostoc; acetic acid bacteria and a further yeast mixture are typical inclusions. Kefir is rich in vitamins B1, B12, folic acid, vitamin K, and biotin, as well as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.Non-dairy probiotic productsDairy products are the main food carriers for probiotic bacteria to human. Limitations of these products such as the presence of allergens, high lactose and cholesterol contents, and the requirement for cold storage facilities have created the need to look for new probiotic product lines based on non-dairy substrates. Several ranges of non-dairy probiotic products have been developed and marketed in the last two decades.Chocolate– The application of probiotic bacteria into chocolate could offer a good alternative to common dairy products, and allow for broadening the health claims of chocolate-based food products. A chocolate mousse was developed by using probiotic and prebiotic ingredients withL. paracaseisubspecies and with the prebiotic ingredient inulin.Soy based products–  Soybeans are typically high in phytic acid, a plant compound that impairs the absorption of minerals like iron and zinc. Fermentation lowers the amount of phytic acid, which may increase the amount of minerals your body is able to absorb from tempeh and other products. It includes the following products:-Miso–  It is made by mixing soybeans with other ingredients, such as barley, rice and rye. Miso is a good source of protein, fiber and various vitamins, minerals and plant compounds, including vitamin K, manganese and copper.Natto– Natto is a fermented soy product that is a staple in Japanese kitchens. It contains a high amount of vitamin K2, which may help prevent osteoporosis and heart attacks.Tempeh– Tempeh serves as a popular, high-protein substitute for meat. It contains a decent amount of vitamin B12, a nutrient found mainly in animal products.Kombucha– It’s made by adding specific strains of bacteria, yeast and sugar to black or green tea, then allowing it to ferment for a week or more. Kombucha is rich in tea polyphenols and acetic acid, which have both been shown to suppress the growth of undesirable bacteria and yeasts as well as helped prevent the growth and spread of cancerous cells. In the market Kombucha is now available in several fruit flavours.Sourdough Bread– It is an old popular bread which has recently risen to popularity! A recent study showed the market value of sourdough increased from $298.7 million in 2014 to $2.4 billion in 2018. Sourdough bread may not seem that different from regular bread, however the fermentation process breaks down some of the gluten, and that makes it more digestible, especially for people who struggle to digest gluten. It helps to keep your gut bacteria happy, and may be less likely to spike blood sugar levels.",

Therefore, there’s no doubt that microbiologists are particularly valuable at the moment.  Especially virologists and those microbiologists that have an understanding of infectious diseases, public health and/or epidemiology.  Plus, some knowledge of immunology can be helpful to for vaccine development as can pharmacology for drug development.  However, it’s really the microbiologists that are coming to the fore.  People talk about ‘saving the world’ and about the impact and importance of careers, but microbiologists really can save the world.  If you had any doubt about the importance of a career in microbiology, then just consider what is happening in the world now and what has happened since December.  …and we’re not just talking about personal and public health, but livelihoods and the global economy.  The economy has gone ‘pear-shaped’ because of a microbiological phenomenon, something that could be stopped by microbiologists, if they are, or were given the opportunity.  The power is in the hands of microbiologists and those with an intricate understanding of microbiology, to save the world, I have no doubt about that.  So, if you want a powerful career, an impactful career, a highly significant career, then consider microbiology!A FOOD MICROBIOLOGY CAREERHow about a career in food microbiology?  What might that look like and what might one be involved with?  Well even in food microbiology there are many varied areas to work in.  The three key areas are: i) food safety, ii) food spoilage/food quality and iii) fermented foods, probiotics and gut health.  Each of these has highly significant impacts on society and on the economy.  Let’s look at each of these in more detail.What is food safety?Food safety is all about ensuring the safety of the food supply.  This means monitoring, auditing, regulating and developing policy for the purposes of safeguarding raw materials and manufactured food over the entire agrifood supply chain from ‘farm to fork’ or ‘paddock to plate’ as the concept goes.  Food safety microbiologists closely associate with epidemiologists, public health professionals and infectious disease experts to combat prevention, tracking and limiting the spread of foodborne diseases of epidemic proportions.What is food spoilage and food quality?Spoilage and subsequent wastage of food results in substantial economic losses.  In countries with developing economies, such spoilage and waste of food is more likely to be fresh produce and thus postharvest and pre-manufacure losses.  In countries with advanced economies, the situation is quite different, with substantial spoilage and waste taking place at the consumer level.  Tight supply chains along with excellent mechanisms of food preservation mean that spoilage losses in such countries are at a minimum.What are fermented foods, probiotics and gut health?This area is closely linked with personal health and wellness.  There is a sustained food trend in the area of probiotics as functional foods, along with prebiotics and people realise the great benefits of how one’s gut health contributes to overall health and wellbeing.  Related to this are fermented foods, many of which are probiotic, and as such, are rich natural sources of ‘good’ bacteria.CAREER PROFILE OF A FOOD MICROBIOLOGISTWondering how a career in food microbiology might actually look like in reality?  Well, I had a Q & A session with Lucy Lam, a food safety auditor from Taipei, Taiwan.  Let’s find out what Lucy’s food microbiology career looks like…What qualification(s) do you hold and from where?Master of Science, with a major in food, nutrition and technology, from The Chinese University of Hong KongBachelor of Food Science, from The University of MelbourneYour present position and where?Auditor, Bureau Veritas Certification  (Taiwan)How would you describe your career ‘in a nutshell’?A passion for food safety and quality control along with being good at problem solving. 1.

Probiotics and gut health,"fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health",A natural way to get your dose of good bacteria.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/a-natural-way-to-get-your-dose-of-good-bacteria/,"December 22, 2019","On Sunday 20 October 2019, I had the opportunity to present this talk twice, at the 2nd annual VegoFest in Melbourne, a celebration of all things ‘vego’, organised by the Vegetarian and Cultural Association Incorporated.  What follows are the slides I used and (almost) a transcript of what I said.Slide 1 – G’day everyone, I’m Philip, an independent food microbiologist at my own start-up institute, Food Microbiology Academy.  Today I want to take you through what is one of the hottest topics in food microbiology at the moment, probiotics and gut health with this presentation titled “A natural way to get your dose of good bacteria”.Slide 2 – Before we actually get into the presentation proper, I want to give you a definition of “natural”, which will be relevant later on in the presentation, since the title of this talk refers to “natural”.  So in the food context, natural refers to a food “having had a minimum of processing or preservative treatment” – just keep this definition in the back of your mind as we progress through the talk.Slide 3 – Now, to start off with, I want to let you know, or remind you that microorganisms are indeed everywhere.  They have colonised every conceivable habitat and environmental niche on the planet – from really hot, to really cold, dark and high pressure environments.  Microorganisms are ubiquitous to the extent that if we can’t find them, then our current technology is probably not good enough to detect them!Slide 4 – Not only are they everywhere in an environmental context, but everywhere includes being on and in us too.  This image is to give you an indication that yes, microorganisms are living, growing and indeed thriving on and in our bodies, even in the harshest environments like the dry and salty skin and the highly acidic and low pH environment of the stomach.Slide 5 – This slide is to give you an indication of some of the so-called good guys and bad guys of the bacterial world, some of which you may have heard about.  Good bacteria include various species ofLactobacillus,Streptococcus thermophilusandBifidobacterium longum.Some of the Bacteria which always spell trouble areSalmonella typhi, most species ofStreptococcusapart fromStreptococcus thermophilusandHelicobacter pylori.Slide 6 – What we have here are some of the general benefits afforded by good gut Bacteria.  Starting at the top right – i) they produce various compounds which assist in digesting food, ii) some of them produce vitamins which are essential in human nutrition, iii) due to the location they reside and their numbers, they exert a protective effect on the epithelial lining of the gut, iv) modulation of the immune system is another important role they play in host non-specific defences and v) they employ various strategies to ward off pathogenic Bacteria, which we’ll cover off in the next slide.Slide 7 – Here we have various means employed by your resident gut Bacteria to resist colonisation by invading pathogenic Bacteria.  Firstly number one, on the left hand side is “Adhesion exclusion” – which means that the pathogens need to adhere to the cells lining the host’s gut in order to exert their disease potential.  However, due to competition for space and adhesion sites which the resident microbiome, the pathogens invariably miss out, and hence are excluded from gaining a ‘foothold’.  Numbers two and three refers to the fact that the pathogenic Bacteria, like all Bacteria and indeed all living organisms refer adequate nutrition.  Limitation on carbon sources, which are used for energy and micronutrients, by the good Bacteria essentially starve the invading Bacteria of the nutrients they need to thrive, grow and even survive.  If this isn’t enough, your resident good Bacteria produce antimicrobial substances and toxins which directly attack ad destroy the ‘bad guys’.  While your gut microbiota is employing all these strategies to ward off the invaders and prevent disease, the pathogens have a host of virulence factors they are expressing to combat everything ‘being thrown at them’.  Basically, there’s a ‘war’ going on in your gut, the good Bacteria of your gut versus the invading pathogenic Bacteria.  If the ‘good guys’ win, you stay healthy, but if the ‘bad guys’ win, then you get sick – it’s as simple as that!Slide 8 – So, we know probiotic Bacteria are good and we need to look after and replenish our gut microbiome, but how?  Well, there’s basically two ways – probiotic supplements, so tablets or pills containing probiotics or the alternative, the more natural way, is to consume fermented foods containing probiotics, such as these yum fermented vegetables.  Something to remember – not all fermented foods contain probiotics and not all fermented foods that are meant to contain probiotics, actually do.  For example, if sauerkraut has been heat treated after fermentation, then the probiotic Bacteria are going to be all but killed off.  Thus, the best option is actually to make your own fermented foods.Slide 9 – Here we have a range of fermented foods displayed, but like we said in the previous slide, not all of them are actually probiotic foods.  Tempeh, kombucha and soy sauce are fermented foods, but do not contain probiotics – even chocolate manufacture includes a fermentation step, but is not considered a probiotic food.  Sauerkraut, kimchi and natto are fantastic vegan probiotic fermented foods while kefir is an excellent probiotic dairy drink.Slide 10 – In this slide I want to concentrate on two fermented cabbage products, Korean kimchi and German sauerkraut.  Both are amongst the healthiest fermented probiotic foods to include in your diet.  They can certainly be considered a physiologically functional food due to all these added benefits they offer – both promote immune system function while interestingly, probiotic lactobacilli starter cultures from kimchi have demonstrated anti-obesity effects when used as a dietary supplement.Slide 11 – So, to sum up – if you take antibiotics, lead a stressful lifestyle, including getting insufficient sleep and are careless with food safety, then you are supporting and encouraging the growth of pathogenic Bacteria.  On the other hand, if you include fermented foods or probiotic supplements in your diet and your diet is healthy, which means, based on fruit and vegetables, then you are providing the best conditions for growth or ‘friendly Bacteria.I’ve included a list below of some books on Amazon related to this topic:Fermented VegetablesRaw Vegan Cuisine & Fermented Foods: Gourmet & Cultured Living Raw Food Recipes.

Public health,"bacteria, public-health","Understanding Cholera: A brief look into its causes, symptoms and prevention",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/understanding-cholera-a-brief-look-into-its-causes-symptoms-and-prevention/,"July 13, 2024","IntroductionCholera is a bacterial infection that is caused by the bacteriumVibro cholerae. This disease is commonly associated with severe diarrhoea and dehydration symptoms, and is typically caused by the ingestion or consumption of contaminated water or food. Even to this day, Cholera is regarded as one of the diseases that poses a major threat to public health, Cholera outbreaks within communities are usually observed following natural disasters, such as floods. This is mainly due to restricted access to a safe drinking water supply as a result of infrastructure damage or destruction.Cholera infections are also more commonly seen in less developed countries, thus making it a main indicator of social and economic inequalities between populations or within communities. Hence, it is of utmost importance for the public to be educated in this area and understand the disease itself. This article focuses on exploring multiple areas of the disease by highlighting its typical causes, commonly experienced symptoms, potential treatments and future prevention measures.Causes of CholeraAs mentioned at the start of this article, the pathogen that is responsible for the symptoms seen in Cholera infections are a species of bacteria known asVibro cholerae. Drinking water can be easily contaminated withVibro cholerae, thus making it unsafe for human consumption. The reasons for contamination of water may vary from one situation to another, however, the improper handling of sewage disposals remains as one of the most common reasons for Cholera outbreaks that is observed in lesser developed countries around the world.The bacteriumVibro choleraecan be spread from one person to another through the faecal oral route. Faecal matter that is passed through a person infected with Cholera disease can go on to contaminate water supplies. Thus failure to properly and adequately treat the water supplies in the distribution system before public consumption can lead to more of the people in a population or community becoming infected with Cholera after they consume the contaminated water.  Other than drinking water,Vibro choleraemay also be spread and passed onto another person through food. This occurs when a person consumes food that has been previously contaminated with theVibro choleraebacteria from an infected person.Symptoms of CholeraThe severity of symptoms may vary from person to person, and usually mainly depends on the strength of an infected person’s immune system. However, symptoms that are typically seen in patients that are infected with Cholera include severe diarrhoea, which is the frequent passage of loose and watery faecal matter, along with dehydration and vomiting.The onset of symptoms are normally rapidly seen after infection with theVibro choleraebacteria. In some people, symptoms may appear as fast as within a few hours following consumption of contaminated food or water. However, it is also possible for symptoms to have a delayed onset in some people, where it only appears after four or five days followingVibro choleraeinfection.Strategies to prevent infectionsand outbreaksCholera is a disease that can be prevented, given appropriate steps are taken by both the individual themselves and also the general community or population living in the area. In order to prevent Cholera infections and outbreaks within the population or community, it is essential to ensure that the water sanitation process in that area is correctly carried out and  maintained. A clean water supply system prior to public distribution is the best way to prevent Cholera outbreaks in the population area.Besides that, prevention measures should also be taken at the individual level. These may include steps to maintain general hygiene habits, such as proper handwashing and having safe food handling processes. Vaccinations are also highly recommended in endemic areas around the world, where Cholera infections and outbreaks are relatively more likely to be seen than other areas.Treatment OptionsThe main method for treatment of Cholera infections include oral rehydration therapy (also known as ORT) and antibiotics. For more severe cases of Cholera infections, supportive care measures should also be taken, and these measures may include the administration of intravenous fluids. The treatment options mentioned above are mainly designed to manage the symptoms of diarrhoea, which is by focusing on the replacement of lost fluids and electrolytes from the body.ConclusionIn conclusion, Cholera infections and outbreaks are largely preventable. It is important to be mindful that these prevention measures do not only depend on personal hygiene practices, but also require global efforts in order to reinforce proper water sanitation processes and also ensure overall improvement of the general public’s awareness on Cholera disease.","cholera, food microbiology, Food safety, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Public health,"bacteria, public-health",Coliforms and their role in ensuring the safety of drinking water,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/coliforms-and-their-role-in-ensuring-the-safety-of-drinking-water/,"June 27, 2024","We are so delighted to welcome Ruby Chin to our team.  Ruby is a 2nd-year biomedical science student at Monash University, with a special interest in microbiology and pharmacology.  She is currently undertaking a four-week industry experience placement with us.  Here’s her first blog article…IntroductionThe water that we drink everyday is regularly treated. In fact, the tap water here in Melbourne, Australia is globally recognised as one of the safest drinking water available. It is absolutely essential to appropriately carry out these water treatment procedures to ensure that it is safe for human consumption and maintain public health. Prior to water treatments, indicator tests are usually carried out to assess the quality of water samples and determine the subsequent steps to be taken afterwards.There are multiple key indicators of water quality, and this is where microbiology comes into play. One of the major indicators of water quality include testing for the presence of coliform bacteria. There are a range of coliforms found naturally in the environment, and having a clear understanding of these microorganisms and the role they play in water quality assessment is key to prevent the spread of waterborne pathogens and diseases. This article discusses what coliforms are, why they matter to us, and how their presence in drinking water relates to water safety and quality.What are coliforms?Coliforms are defined as a group of Gram-negative bacteria that has a rod-shaped morphology. Coliforms that are incubated in laboratories at a temperature between 35 to 37 degree Celsius are able to ferment lactose and in return, produce acids and gases that are released into their environment. They are commonly found in human intestines but usually possess no harm or health risks to us.Despite being harmless within the gastrointestinal tract of our bodies, the detection of coliforms in drinking water can be very helpful, since their presence indicates the potential contamination of water. Water contamination or pollution is typically caused by pathogens that are found within faecal matter. Thus, failure to treat faecal-contaminated water before public distribution poses a serious health risk to the community that is dependent on the water supply.As previously mentioned, there are various types of coliforms around us, withEscherichia colibeing the one of the most well-known examples of a coliform bacteria that is commonly found in faecal matter. Hence, its presence in water samples taken from distribution systems serve as a major indicator of recent faecal contamination of the water.BesidesE. coli, there are two other major types of coliforms – total coliform and faecal coliforms. A range of bacterial species makes up the total coliform group, while total coliforms that are mostly found in faecal matter are separately known as faecal coliforms.How coliforms are detectedDetection tests for coliforms are done by obtaining water samples across different points of the water distribution system. These samples are then carefully screened and analysed by experts for the presence of coliforms. The level of coliforms in the water sample directly correlates to the quality of the water. Although different countries normally have varying standards when it comes to determining the safety of the water for human consumption, one of the major guidelines that is generally accepted is that no total coliform colonies should be present in each 100 millilitres of water that is tested.The importance of coliformsAs stated earlier, coliform detection tests are widely used to ensure water quality and safety. Their presence provides us with early identification of water contamination so that necessary interventions and prevention measures can be promptly taken. This effectively decreases the cases of waterborne illnesses and diseases within a community as it allows time for the contaminated drinking water to be properly treated before public distribution and consumption.It should also be noted that besides bacteria, other harmful pathogens, including viruses and protozoa can also be found in faecal matter. Consumption of these water pathogens can result in detrimental health effects too, such as problems with the gut and heart. Timely intervention is therefore crucial to reduce health risks of the public, and failure to do so can significantly impact the community’s general quality of life and economy.ConclusionAs of today, most countries and organisations around the world have established their own regulatory standards in regards to the quality of drinking water. This highlights the crucial role of coliforms and how early detection of them is paramount to ensure safe drinking water for human consumption.Coliforms have served as a great example of how a good understanding of the features and role of specific microbes can immensely help us to build a healthier and safer community by making appropriate interventions and taking proactive measures against them.","foodborne disease, microbiology, water quality"
Public health,"bacteria, public-health",Diverse burden of foodborne disease,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/diverse-burden-of-foodborne-disease/,"May 26, 2024","Foodborne diseases, often referred to as foodborne illnesses, are infections or irritations of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract caused by food or beverages containing harmful bacteria, parasites, viruses, or chemicals. Despite advancements in food safety, these diseases continue to pose a significant threat to public health globally. This article delves into the diverse burden of foodborne disease, exploring its multifaceted impact on health, economies, and societies.Understanding foodborne diseasesFoodborne diseases are typically caused by consuming contaminated food or beverages. Common pathogens include bacteria likeSalmonella,Escherichia coli, andListeriamonocytogenes; viruses such as norovirus and hepatitis A; and parasites likeGiardiaandToxoplasma. Additionally, chemical contaminants, including pesticides and heavy metals, can also cause foodborne illnesses.Health impactThe health burden of foodborne diseases is substantial and diverse. These diseases range from mild gastroenteritis, which can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, to severe and life-threatening conditions such as hemolytic uremic syndrome, liver failure, and meningitis. Vulnerable populations, including infants, young children, pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals, are particularly at risk for severe outcomes.Morbidity and mortality:Foodborne diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that each year, one in ten people fall ill after consuming contaminated food, leading to approximately 420 000 deaths globally. Children under five years of age are disproportionately affected, accounting for 40% of the disease burden and 30% of deaths.Chronic health consequences:Beyond acute illness, foodborne diseases can lead to long-term health complications. For instance, certain strains ofE. colican cause kidney failure and long-term renal issues.Campylobacterinfections are associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a serious condition that can result in paralysis. These chronic consequences place a prolonged burden on individuals and healthcare systems.Economic ImpactThe economic burden of foodborne diseases is immense. It affects multiple sectors, including healthcare, agriculture, and food industries.Healthcare costs:The direct medical costs associated with treating foodborne illnesses are significant. These include expenses for hospitalization, medical consultations, diagnostic tests, and medications. Indirect costs, such as lost productivity due to illness and long-term disability, further exacerbate the economic impact.Loss of productivity:Foodborne diseases lead to substantial productivity losses. Sick individuals may be unable to work, attend school, or perform daily activities, leading to absenteeism and reduced economic output. In some cases, caregivers also miss work to tend to sick family members, compounding the economic loss.Impact on food fndustries:Foodborne disease outbreaks can have devastating effects on food industries. Contaminated food products must be recalled, leading to financial losses and damage to brand reputation. Additionally, legal liabilities and compensation claims can further strain businesses. For instance, the 2008Salmonellaoutbreak linked to peanut butter in the United States led to a significant financial impact on the peanut industry and related businesses.Social and psychological impactThe social and psychological impact of foodborne diseases is often overlooked but equally important.Fear and anxiety:Recurring foodborne disease outbreaks create fear and anxiety among consumers, eroding trust in food safety systems. People may become overly cautious or anxious about food consumption, which can affect their overall quality of life.Stigmatisation:Individuals and communities associated with foodborne disease outbreaks can face stigmatisation. For example, regions known for producing contaminated food products may suffer from a tarnished reputation, affecting tourism and local economies.Behavioral changes:Foodborne disease outbreaks can lead to significant changes in consumer behavior. People may avoid certain foods, switch to more expensive or processed alternatives, or adopt stringent food safety practices, which can impact dietary diversity and nutrition.Addressing the burden of foodborne diseasesCombating the burden of foodborne diseases requires a multi-faceted approach involving various stakeholders, including governments, international organisations, food industries, and consumers.Strengthening food safety systems:Governments and regulatory agencies play a crucial role in ensuring food safety. This involves establishing and enforcing food safety regulations, conducting regular inspections, and promoting good agricultural and manufacturing practices. Additionally, investing in food safety infrastructure, such as laboratories and surveillance systems, is essential for early detection and response to foodborne disease outbreaks.Public health education:Educating the public about food safety practices is vital. Campaigns to raise awareness about proper food handling, cooking, and storage can significantly reduce the risk of foodborne diseases. Schools, community organizations, and healthcare providers can play an active role in disseminating this information.International collaboration:Foodborne diseases do not respect borders, and international collaboration is essential for effective prevention and control. Organizations like the WHO, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and the World Trade Organization (WTO) work together to develop global food safety standards and promote their implementation.Research and innovation:Continued research into foodborne pathogens, their transmission, and prevention methods is crucial. Innovations in food processing, packaging, and preservation can enhance food safety. Additionally, the development of rapid diagnostic tools and vaccines for foodborne pathogens holds promise for reducing the disease burden.Consumer responsibility:Consumers also have a role to play in preventing foodborne diseases. Practicing good food hygiene, such as washing hands before handling food, cooking food to safe temperatures, and avoiding cross-contamination, can reduce the risk of illness. Being informed and making conscientious food choices can contribute to overall food safety.ConclusionThe burden of foodborne diseases is diverse and far-reaching, impacting health, economies, and societies worldwide. Addressing this burden requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders, including governments, international organizations, food industries, and consumers. By strengthening food safety systems, promoting public health education, fostering international collaboration, investing in research and innovation, and encouraging responsible consumer behavior, we can mitigate the impact of foodborne diseases and ensure safer food for all.","food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Public health,"bacteria, public-health, viruses",Emerging pathogens in the food supply chain: A growing concern for global health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/emerging-pathogens-in-the-food-supply-chain-a-growing-concern-for-global-health/,"April 13, 2024","In today’s globalised world, the food supply chain is more interconnected than ever before. This interconnectedness, while beneficial for meeting the dietary demands of a growing population, also poses significant risks in the form of emerging pathogens that can quickly spread across borders. Understanding the dynamics of these pathogens, their impact on public health, and the measures needed to mitigate their threats is crucial for ensuring food safety.The nature of emerging pathogensEmerging pathogens are defined as microbes that have recently appeared within a population or those whose incidence or geographic range is rapidly increasing. In the context of the food supply chain, these can include bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi that contaminate food products and cause illness in consumers. Examples of such pathogens that have had significant impacts on public health includeE. coliO157:H7,Salmonella, andListeriamonocytogenes, among others.These pathogens can enter the food supply chain at various points, from production and processing to distribution and retail. Changes in agricultural practices, environmental factors, global trade, and even consumer preferences can influence the emergence and spread of these pathogens.Factors contributing to the rise of emerging pathogensSeveral factors contribute to the rise and spread of emerging pathogens in the food supply chain:Globalisation of food supply: As food travels longer distances to reach global markets, there is increased risk of contamination at multiple points along the supply chain. Different regions may have varying standards for food safety, complicating the management of foodborne pathogens.Intensive farming practices: High-density farming provides ideal conditions for the rapid spread and mutation of microbes. The use of antibiotics and pesticides can also contribute to the development of resistant strains of pathogens.Climate change: Changing climate conditions affect the habitats of many organisms, including pathogens. Increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns can lead to the proliferation of foodborne pathogens and extend their geographical range.Consumer preferences: The demand for organic and raw foods has increased. While these foods are often perceived as healthier, they may also bypass some of the processing steps designed to eliminate pathogens, thus posing additional risks...Case studies of emerging pathogensSeveral outbreaks have highlighted the risks associated with emerging pathogens in recent years:E. coliin leafy greens: Repeated incidents ofE. colicontaminations in romaine lettuce have led to significant illness across several states, prompting widespread recalls and re-evaluation of farming and processing practices for leafy greens.Listeria in frozen vegetables: A multinational outbreak of Listeria linked to frozen vegetables affected several countries in Europe, leading to long-term changes in the processing, freezing, packaging, and storage of frozen products.Hepatitis A in pomegranate seeds: An outbreak of Hepatitis A associated with pomegranate seeds imported from Turkey affected several people in Australia, emphasising the need for better control of imported foods.Mitigating the risksControlling the spread of emerging pathogens in the food supply chain requires a multi-faceted approach:Enhanced surveillance and reporting: Early detection of outbreaks through improved surveillance and rapid reporting systems can help in quickly identifying the source of contamination and preventing the spread of disease.Strict regulatory standards: Implementing and enforcing stringent food safety regulations both domestically and internationally can help minimise the risk of contamination. Standards should be based on scientific evidence and regularly updated to reflect the changing nature of pathogens.Advanced detection technologies: Investing in newer and more precise detection technologies can help identify pathogens at lower concentrations and with greater accuracy, before the contaminated products reach the consumer.Consumer education: Educating consumers about safe food handling practices and the risks associated with certain types of foods can reduce foodborne illnesses. Simple practices, such as washing hands and surfaces often, can prevent the spread of bacteria.Cooperation and communication: Effective communication and collaboration among governments, industry stakeholders, and international bodies are essential for managing the risks associated with foodborne pathogens.

Public health,"bacteria, public-health",Food safety regulation in the United States,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-safety-regulation-in-the-united-states/,"May 24, 2023","Here are ten food safety fast facts from the United States:Each year, about 48 million people in the United States get sick from foodborne illnesses. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Out of these 48 million cases of foodborne illnesses, about 128 000 people are hospitalised and 3 000 people die. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)The most common causes of foodborne illnesses in the United States are norovirus,Salmonella,Clostridiumperfringens, andCampylobacter. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)The most common food products associated with foodborne illnesses are leafy greens, eggs, chicken, beef, and pork. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Foodborne illnesses are most common in the summer months, with the highest number of cases reported in July and August. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)Food recalls in the United States have been increasing in recent years, with 905 recalls reported in 2019. (Source: Food Safety Magazine)The most common reasons for food recalls in the United States are undeclared allergens, bacterial contamination, and foreign objects in food. (Source: Food Safety Magazine)In 2018, the United States imported $129 billion worth of food and agricultural products. (Source: United States Department of Agriculture)The FDA inspects about 20% of the food products that are imported into the United States. (Source: Food Safety Magazine)Food safety violations can result in fines, recalls, and even criminal charges. In 2019, a California company was ordered to pay a $1 million fine for selling contaminated sprouts that caused aSalmonellaoutbreak. (Source: Food Safety News)Food safety is a critical issue that affects the health and well-being of millions of people in the United States. As a result, the federal government has implemented a series of regulations and guidelines to ensure the safety and quality of the food supply. In this essay, we will explore how food safety is regulated in the United States and the measures that are in place to protect consumers.The primary agency responsible for regulating food safety in the United States is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA is responsible for ensuring that all food products sold in the United States are safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. The FDA has the authority to inspect food facilities, enforce food safety regulations, and initiate recalls of unsafe food products.One of the most significant regulations implemented by the FDA is the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), which was signed into law in 2011. The FSMA represents the most significant overhaul of the food safety system in the United States in over 70 years. The act focuses on preventing foodborne illnesses rather than just responding to them after they occur. It requires food facilities to have written plans for identifying and preventing potential hazards in their operations, and it gives the FDA the authority to enforce these plans through inspections and other measures.Another key agency responsible for food safety regulation is the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA is responsible for ensuring the safety and quality of meat, poultry, and egg products. The agency inspects slaughterhouses and processing facilities, monitors labeling and packaging, and enforces regulations related to animal welfare.The USDA also oversees the labeling of organic foods. Organic foods are produced without the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, genetic engineering, irradiation, or sewage sludge. The USDA has established guidelines for organic certification, and products that meet these guidelines can be labeled as “USDA Organic.”In addition to the FDA and USDA, several other agencies play a role in food safety regulation. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the use of pesticides on crops, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks outbreaks of foodborne illnesses and provides guidance on how to prevent them.To ensure that food products are safe and of high quality, the FDA and USDA conduct inspections of food facilities. These inspections are designed to identify potential hazards in food production and to ensure that facilities are complying with food safety regulations. The frequency of inspections varies depending on the type of facility and the level of risk associated with the products it produces.If a food product is found to be unsafe, the FDA or USDA may issue a recall. A recall is a voluntary or mandatory action taken by a manufacturer or distributor to remove a product from the market. The purpose of a recall is to protect consumers from potentially harmful products. The FDA and USDA have the authority to require a recall if a company does not take voluntary action to remove a product from the market.To further ensure food safety, the FDA and USDA work closely with state and local health departments. State and local health departments are responsible for inspecting food service establishments, such as restaurants and grocery stores, and for investigating outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. These departments also work with the FDA and USDA to monitor food imports and to enforce food safety regulations at the local level.In conclusion, food safety is a critical issue that affects the health and well-being of millions of people in the United States. The FDA, USDA, EPA, CDC, and state and local health departments all play a role in regulating food safety in the United States. Through a combination of regulations, inspections, and recalls, these agencies work to ensure that the food supply is safe and of high quality. While no system is perfect, the measures in place have significantly reduced the number of foodborne illnesses in the United States and have helped to protect the health of consumers.","food microbiology, food regulations, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Public health,"bacteria, public-health",Is our food supply becoming less safe?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/is-our-food-supply-becoming-less-safe/,"February 17, 2023","A question that is not uncommon, especially from critics of contemporary food production, manufacturing and distribution.  Yes, it is a legitimate question, and one that is certainly valid, but certainly one that is particularly complex.  It is difficult to make a blanket statement about the overall safety of the food supply as it can vary by country and region. However, there have been concerns about food safety in recent years, such as the rise in food recalls and outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. Factors such as industrialization of agriculture, globalization of the food supply, and changes in consumer preferences can also play a role in food safety. It’s important for individuals to take steps to protect themselves, such as practicing proper food handling and preparation techniques, and staying informed about food recalls and outbreaks in their area.The history of food regulations and food standards in the 19th and 20th centuries has been marked by both progress and setbacks in ensuring the safety of the food supply.In the 19th century, the industrialisation of food production and the growth of cities led to increased concerns about the safety and purity of food. This led to the creation of early food regulations, such as the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 in the United States, which aimed to prevent the sale of adulterated or mislabeled food.However, these early regulations were often inadequate and poorly enforced, which led to continued problems with food safety. For example, the use of harmful chemicals such as lead and copper in food products was not adequately regulated, and many food products were adulterated with cheaper ingredients.In the 20th century, food safety regulations improved with the introduction of better scientific methods for detecting and preventing foodborne illness. The development of pasteurisation and refrigeration, along with the creation of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) improved the food safety.However, the regulations also had some negative consequences. For example, the use of pesticides and other chemicals in agriculture increased, which led to concerns about the safety of these substances and their potential impacts on human health and the environment. Additionally, the industrialization of food production led to the concentration of food production in a few large companies, which made the food supply more vulnerable to contamination.In summary, while food regulations and standards have improved over time, they have not always been sufficient to ensure the safety of the food supply and some regulations have even contributed to making food unsafe in the past. Food safety is a complex issue that requires ongoing attention, research and improvement to ensure the safety of the food supply for all.Governments take various actions to address food safety and foodborne disease outbreaks. Some of the actions that governments may take include:Implementing food safety regulations: Governments may establish and enforce regulations that set standards for the production, processing, and distribution of food. These regulations may cover issues such as food hygiene, food labeling, and the use of pesticides and other chemicals.Establishing food safety agencies: Governments may establish agencies responsible for enforcing food safety regulations and investigating foodborne disease outbreaks. These agencies may also provide education and training to food producers and processors to help them comply with regulations.Conducting surveillance and outbreak investigations: Governments may conduct surveillance for foodborne disease outbreaks and investigate outbreaks when they occur. This may involve collecting and analyzing data on illnesses and deaths, identifying the source of the outbreak, and taking action to control the spread of the disease.Developing food safety guidelines and recommendations: Governments may develop guidelines and recommendations to help food producers, processors, and consumers reduce their risk of foodborne illness.Increasing food import and export inspection: Governments may increase their inspections on food imports and exports to ensure that the food meets safety standards.Collaborating with international organizations: Governments may collaborate with international organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to share information and coordinate efforts to address food safety and foodborne disease outbreaks.It’s important to note that the actions taken by governments may vary depending on the country or region, and the level of resources available to them.There are several global trends in foodborne disease that have been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations. Some of these include:An increase in the number of reported foodborne outbreaks: This is likely due to improved surveillance and reporting systems, as well as an increase in the globalization of the food supply.A shift in the types of pathogens causing foodborne illness: In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of outbreaks caused by non-traditional foodborne pathogens such as norovirus and Shiga toxin-producingE. coli(STEC), which are more difficult to detect and control than traditional pathogens likeSalmonellaandE. coliO157:H7.An increase in the number of multi-country outbreaks: The globalization of the food supply has led to an increase in the number of outbreaks that affect multiple countries, making them more difficult to control and investigate.An increase in the number of outbreaks linked to fresh produce: This is likely due to the increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as changes in agricultural practices that can increase the risk of contamination.A rise in antimicrobial resistance (AMR): The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in agriculture can lead to the development of AMR, which can make it more difficult to control foodborne pathogens and treat infections.It’s important to note that these trends are subject to change over time and may vary depending on the region or country.","food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Public health,"bacteria, food-safety, public-health",Aeromonas hydrophila – is it worth worrying about?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/aeromonas-hydrophila-is-it-worth-worrying-about/,"January 25, 2023","Aeromonas hydrophilais a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria that belongs to the family Aeromonadaceae. It was first identified by a Japanese scientist in 1892 and is considered as one of the first species of the genusAeromonas.   The genus Aeromonas, is composed of several species,Aeromonas hydrophilais one of the most well-known and studied species in this genus.  It is important to note that,Aeromonas hydrophilais considered a complex species, meaning that it is composed of several sub-groups with different levels of pathogenic potential, which can cause different types of infections in humans and animals.Taxonomically,Aeromonas hydrophilafalls under the following classification:Domain: BacteriaPhylum: ProteobacteriaClass: GammaproteobacteriaOrder: AeromonadalesFamily: AeromonadaceaeGenus:AeromonasSpecies:Aeromonas hydrophilaThis species is commonly found in freshwater environments such as rivers, lakes, and ponds. It can also be found in brackish water and in the intestinal tracts of some fish species. In fish,Aeromonas hydrophilacan cause a variety of diseases, including septicemia, wound infections, and fin and tail rot. Symptoms of a fish infected withAeromonas hydrophilamay include redness, swelling, and ulceration of the skin, as well as fin and tail damage. It’s important to maintain good water quality and hygiene in fish tanks and aquaculture systems to prevent the spread ofAeromonas hydrophilaand other fish diseases. If your fish are showing signs of infection, it’s best to consult a veterinarian or fish health expert for proper diagnosis and treatment.  The presence ofAeromonas hydrophilain the aquatic environment is not necessarily a cause for concern, as the bacteria is a normal part of the aquatic microbial community. However, high levels of the bacteria in water or fish may indicate poor water quality or overcrowding in aquaculture systems, which can lead to increased risk of disease in fish and other aquatic animals.A. hydrophilacan cause foodborne illness in humans, although it is less common than other foodborne pathogens such asSalmonellaandE. coli. The bacteria can be found in raw or undercooked meat and seafood, as well as in fresh produce that has been contaminated with water or sewage. Aeromonas hydrophila can also survive and grow in refrigerated foods, making it important to store and handle food properly to prevent the growth and spread of the bacteria.Symptoms ofAeromonas hydrophilainfection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, and fever. These symptoms usually appear within 24 to 48 hours after consuming contaminated food. In severe cases, Aeromonas hydrophila infection can lead to dehydration and blood infections.To prevent foodborne illness caused byAeromonas hydrophila, it is important to handle food properly, cook meat and seafood thoroughly, and to practice good personal hygiene. It is also important to properly clean and sanitize cutting boards and other kitchen tools to prevent cross-contamination.AlthoughAeromonas hydrophilais a rare cause of foodborne illness, there have been several reported outbreaks of disease associated with the bacteria in recent years.In 2019, United Kingdom, over 30 cases. Cause: raw or undercooked meat from a local butcher shop.In 2018, United States, over 20 cases. Cause: raw or undercooked pork products from a local distributor.In 2017, Germany, over 50 cases. Cause: raw or undercooked fish products from a local market.In 2015, United States, over 20 cases. Cause: raw oysters harvested from a local estuary.These are just a few examples of reported outbreaks involvingAeromonas hydrophila, it’s important to note that most cases of foodborne illness caused byAeromonasare not reported or recognized, it is usually underdiagnosed due to its similarity to other enteric pathogens.Aeromonas hydrophilacan be identified in the microbiology laboratory using a variety of methods, including cultural, biochemical, serological, and molecular techniques.Cultural methods involve growing the bacteria on selective and differential media, such as thiosulfate-citrate-bile-sucrose (TCBS) agar or cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin (CIN) agar, which are formulated to selectively promote the growth ofAeromonasspecies while inhibiting the growth of other bacteria.Biochemical methods involve testing the bacteria’s ability to ferment various sugars or produce certain enzymes. For example,Aeromonashydrophila is able to ferment lactose and produce the enzyme catalase.Serological methods, such as the slide agglutination test, can be used to identifyAeromonas hydrophilaby detecting specific antigens in the bacteria.Molecular methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing, can be used to specifically detect and identifyAeromonas hydrophilaby targeting specific genetic regions of the bacteria.It’s worth to note that,Aeromonas hydrophilais a part of theAeromonasgenus which encompasses a number of species, therefore it is important to use multiple methods to confirm the identification ofAeromonas hydrophilain the lab.","fish disease, food microbiology, food science, foodborne disease"
Public health,"food-spoilage, public-health, viruses",Saving the world,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/saving-the-world/,"January 18, 2022","Outline of problems of the world, where we are with them and how microorganisms may help.As much as humans believe they can do anything, and essentially effect total control over the world, the biosphere and our planet, we have a major global pandemic put everything into perspective for us.  This demonstrates how the unseen can exert near total control, how an entity that doesn’t even satisfy the criteria to be classified as a form of life, can wreak catastrophic havoc.  However, the microbial world must not be seen as evil, for it is the delicate balance in our biosphere, driven by microorganisms that has not only brought stability our world for billions of years, but gradually allowed a myriad of lifeforms to evolve and flourish.  Despite the resilience of the microbial-stabilised biosphere, our planet must not be taken for granted.  We have assumed the role as the current custodians of our planet and are privileged with the responsibility of ensuring it remains habitable, not just for our species, but for as many species’ as possible.  This requires an acknowledgement of the key role of microorganisms in this aspect, through their fundamental contribution to energy and nutrient cycling along with their base position in many food webs, especially those in aquatic biomes, which cover around three quarters of our planet.  The absolute fundamental contribution of microorganisms to sustainable agriculture and hence food production and food security through stabilisation of climatic deterioration and biospheric harmony not only requires acknowledgement, but action.  We can do this, we are all in this together, what we must all do our part to keep this world habitable, then to improve our planet and ultimately, to ensure the longevity of our planet in the face of mounting challenges.  The answers to do all this lie with microorganisms, from a multitude of perspectives – newly developed probiotic and/or fermented manufactured foods, regenerative agriculture, restriction of antibiotic use in livestock, to name some of the ways that microorganisms can contribute to widespread improvements in our world.Society appears to have reached the stage where traditional scientific approaches may not be able to sustain humanity into the future.  Not only does technology need to continue progressing, but so do people’s mindsets and attitudes.  These are key to furthering society as in many instances throughout history, advances have been limited by resistance from consumers, the general public, who have staunch beliefs and attachments to their traditions and what they are familiar with.  However, the general public must move past this, because these technologies of the future (and even technologies of the past, that have met with untold resistance) are needed to advance humanity, in fact, putting it simply, for society to have a chance of addressing the immense global challenges in the space of agriculture and food, policy makers will need to be able to select from any (safe) technology that is available.  Two that come to mind are food irradiation for food preservation and recombinant DNA technology for development of crops able to better provide food for the continued boom in population growth expected over the coming decades.  Both of these, are in some form, associated with microbiology.What are the big problems of the world?  Furthermore, can we predict what might be global or significant regional challenges that we haven’t encountered yet?  Perhaps not.  Look at the ongoing impact of COVID-19.  In the late 2000s, Barclay (2008) provided insights into attempts to predict future pandemics.  Not long after that, yet another influenza pandemic swept the world and then, 10 years on from that pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 emerged.  It is easy to say that humanity is at the mercy of infectious disease, but even if the science was equal to the task, there are complex social and political considerations at play, many of which stem from traditions, attachments and the generally strong mindsets and attitudes that are not easy to shift.  A way to address this, is perhaps, two-pronged.  Involvement of the general community in so-called ‘citizen science’ projects along with sustained consumer awareness campaigns carried out in parallel.There’s no doubt food in general is at the cornerstone of humanity’s issues.  Whether this be food security, improving yield, reducing spoilage and food waste, farming marginal lands or combating foodborne disease, these are all major contemporary issues.  If any of these could be successfully addressed, just one, it would be a miraculous achievement for humanity.  They do present seemingly insurmountable hurdles to society, but there are answers, science really has the potential to answer them and especially so microbiology.  How can this be?  Furthermore, is it really that easy and how can we be sure that microbiology has the answers?  Of course we cannot, but the microbial world has provided, has had many solutions to humanity, over millennia.  There have been profound solutions, solutions to problems that have changed the course of humanity – take antibiotics.  Solutions so significant that they are still practiced to this day, under the same that they were thousands of years ago, for example fermented food products.  Microbiology, and the answers it has given and revolutions it has helped develop are amongst the most significant over the entire course of human history.  Therefore, the secrets of the microbial world are just waiting to be unlocked, explored and from there, we may just discover many tools that will save humanity, solve the challenges of the world and perhaps, again, change the course of humanity.ReferenceBarclay, E., 2008.

Public health,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, public-health",Part 2 of antibiotic resistance,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/part-2-of-antibiotic-resistance/,"December 3, 2021","Antibiotic resistance is a significant global challenge, fast becoming one of this century’s most significant issues.  Not only does it have concerns in human and veterinary medicine, in agriculture and food science, but in public health too.  We must act now to stem the tide, the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, before it becomes an insurmountable obstacle and drives the demise of humanity, of civilisation.Let us launch straight into the concerns of antibiotic use for our own personal health…Another important problem is associated with our own microbiome, primarily our gut microbiome, since many antibiotics are taken orally.  Unfortunately, a substantial number of antibiotics are prescribed rapidly and without reference to any antimicrobial sensitivity testing.  Under such circumstances, patients almost demand an antibiotic prescription after visiting a clinician.  The medico, under this kind of pressure from their patient, doesn’t have the time to wait up to 48 hours (or longer) for an antimicrobial sensitivity test result, typically doesn’t even request a sample, rather, prescribes a broad spectrum antibiotic, often based on nothing more than clinical observation and possible symptom history, which may be sometimes unreliable.  While this is a quick and easy way to satisfy a patient, it is harmful in multiple ways.  For example, indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics will contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes during active infections and among human and environmental reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria.  Furthermore, the patient will be unaware that taking a broad spectrum antibiotic may or may not eliminate the bacteria troubling them, but even if it does, it is highly likely to do untold damage to the host’s own flora, their microbial ecosystem.  This could open the patient up to side effects or additional infections, once the protection, primarily from the gut microbiota is severely disrupted.  Severely disrupted to the stage where opportunistic pathogenic bacteria could gain a ‘foothold’, resulting in an additional and subsequent infection(s).  So, indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics is certainly highly likely to do more harm (in the longer term) than good (n the shorter term).The way microorganisms can potentially address this, while largely unknown, would surely lie within the immense unknown prokaryotic diversity that remains to be discovered.  A few years ago,Locey and Lennon (2016)provided an updated estimation of the total prokaryotic species on our planet, which they said, is likely to be in excess of one trillion.  We currently are aware of an absolute minuscule proportion of this estimated total.  Therefore, simply by intensifying research investigations of extreme environments for yet-to-be discovered microbes and developing means to actually culture them, is likely to hold a key to humanity’s success.  Just through a trial and error investigation of the microbial world, we are highly likely to unlock some prokaryotic secrets that could hold value in addressing our global challenges.  Really, it could very well be a numbers game – with so many undiscovered species and undiscovered potential, the answers are likely to be there, if we look long and hard enough.  An important element of this though is keeping an open mind.  Keeping an open mind with regard to what we are looking for, where we look for it, how we look for it, how they are cultured and more.  If we don’t, we could very well miss the opportunity of a lifetime to change the course of humanity.  It takes sharpness, alertness and looking at situations from a different perspective to be able to recognise potential.  IfAlexander Fleming hadn’t noticed on 28 September 1928that a contaminating mould was inhibiting the growth of an important human pathogenic bacterium, the world would be a different place today.  He could have easily seen the contaminating mould on that agar plate, thrown it away, and an opportunity to change the course of humanity would have been lost.Scouring the unexplored microbial world for compounds of potential use which can be used to address human challenges is one aspect, and a key area where global efforts should be directed.  However, as old as fermented foods and probiotics are, they hold much potential to further address issues of public health associated with diet, which really, is the cornerstone to good health of everyone.  Even though each of us contain untold diversity in our own microbiome, it is still not well understood.  Innovative analytical methods are needed to improve characterisation of the human microbiome.  Furthermore, the way it is linked to a range of elements and indicators of health needs to be elucidated.  This could result in targeted food product development activities and direct public health messages, based on sound science, around what will be beneficial for health within the context of today’s lifestyle.  Furthermore, fermented foods are trending and this trend and positive image by consumers should be explored further to produce diverse fermented foods that are able to bring great public health benefits while satisfying people’s increasing desire for exotic tastes with new foods.  There are countless microorganisms of fermentative potential, and numerous types of food substrates that could be used to develop a wide range of natural and healthy foods. Consumers’ positivity towards fermented foods and beverages should really be explored further to bring them products likely to gain rapid market acceptance.  The idea is that with improved public health from improved personal health resulting from healthier eating of diverse food products of microbial origin, there would be less reliance on antibiotics.","agriculture, antibiotic resistance, food microbiology, human medicine, microbiology, probiotics, veterinary medicine"
Public health,"bacteria, public-health",Part 1 of antibiotic resistance,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/part-1-of-antibiotic-resistance/,"November 3, 2021","An introduction to the relationship between microbiology and the big global issues of our time.  Microorganisms are indispensable to the human existence.  Although less in the spotlight, the beneficial effects of microorganisms for various aspects of human endeavour cannot be underestimated.  Life as we know it would not be sustainable without the contributions of a myriad of microorganisms.  From the global diversity of fermented foods produced by microorganisms to the probiotics that contribute to ensuring a stable gut microbiome for a range of personal health benefits, from gut health to mental health, microorganisms are the cornerstone of humanity’s success.  Furthermore, there are indirect benefits to our food supply, through the positive contributions microorganisms make to agriculture, from livestock probiotics to regenerating soil and reducing crop reliance on traditional pesticides, the array of benefits and their significance is staggering.  As a global society exploring options to address the significant challenges of our time, the importance of microbial contributions to human activities is likely to increase.  As crises associated with climate, environmental damage, population growth, infectious disease outbreaks, food insecurity and more increase in prominence, the world is likely to turn microbial-associated solutions.  From supply of nutritious foods and combating infectious diseases to bioremediation and regeneration of agricultural land, microorganisms have demonstrated their wide-ranging potential.  Thus, the key to longevity of humanity on this planet, and maybe even colonisation of other planets, could very well lie with unlocking the secrets of known, and yet to be discovered microorganisms.  There is an immense amount we are unaware of, in the microbial world, in fact, we may even be ignorant to what we don’t know.  Consequently, microbiology stands at the edge of an very exciting period, with food microbiology in particular, being on the verge of contributing much to enable humanity to overcome some of the greatest challenges ever faced – we just need to further tap into the richness of the microbial world and harness it’s treasures in a way that brings harmony to the biosphere.If we first look at antibiotics – there’s no doubt over the significance for humanity of antibiotics.  The chance discovery in 1928 (Fleming, 1929), and the subsequent trials and commercialisation that led to penicillin use during the first world war no doubt started a revolution in public health.  No longer were many bacterial infectious diseases to be feared to the extent they once were.  Penicillin changed the course of medicine (Gaynes, 2017) and there’s no doubt that the world was never the same during this antibiotic era compared with before.  Reductions in illness and death along with increases in longevity have changed the face of society as antibiotic use became routinely available across the globe.  As with many tools, when they are used for their intended use, little harm occurs and any risk or hazards can be more easily managed.  Antibiotics are meant to either stop the growth of invading pathogenic bacteria, thus giving the host’s immune system a better chance to combat the infection or go one step further and actually eliminate the invading pathogenic bacteria, on behalf of the host’s immune system.  Antibiotics should not be used routinely and/or regularly (except in rare and exceptional circumstances) and definitely should not be used in a preventative capacity.  It is therefore important to remember some key points; I) Antibiotics are part of natural microbial defence mechanisms, II) Antibiotics can act as broad-spectrum (effective against a wide range of bacterial species) or narrow-spectrum (effective against a limited range of bacterial species), III) Bacteria have short generation times and therefore can undergo rapid mutation, IV) Gene transfer between bacterial species to facilitate the dominance of beneficial phenotypes can occur frequently.Overzealous prescription of antibiotics, in combination with the demanding attitude of some patients and those patients that don’t follow antibiotics’ instructions for use, certainly contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance and damage to the human microbiome.  However, it is excessive veterinary use, or misuse, of antibiotics in agriculture, which is potentially more cause for concern.  Legitimate use of antibiotics for control of active infections, as is the case with humans, is one thing, but when antibiotics are used to prevent infections in livestock and then for other growth promoting purposes in animal-based agricultural systems, then that is bad news.  Antibiotics were never designed for routine prevention use, and should never be used in this way.  Why is this?  When there’s an environment where antibiotics are constantly present, that becomes the norm.  This will select for bacteria that are able to grow better under such conditions, meaning the constant presence of antibiotics will select for antibiotic resistant bacteria – that’s just the way nature works.  Antibiotic resistant bacteria, or better put, bacteria containing genes, either on their chromosome or more typically plasmid-borne, for antibiotic resistance are clearly going to be at an advantage over those bacteria that don’t have such genes.  It is worth reiterating that antibiotic resistant genes are always present, but under normal circumstances, without the (constant) presence of antibiotics, bacteria which have such genes are at no selective growth advantage over those bacteria that don’t have such genes.  Therefore, such bacteria remain at a consistently low proportion.  With increasing exposure to antibiotics, the bacteria that do not have antibiotic resistance genes will be less competitive in such an environment and start to die off at a greater level, reducing in proportion as the selection pressure favours those bacteria with antibiotic resistance genes.  As exposure to antibiotics continues, the scale tips more and more in favour of bacteria that possess antibiotic resistance genes, which increase in proportion in that population.https://www.reactgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/190318-Natural-selection-ReAct.pngReferencesFleming, A., 1929.

Public health,public-health,"Food security, food safety and food regulations in Nepal.",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-security-food-safety-and-food-regulations-in-nepal/,"October 2, 2021","In this, the first of a three-part series on food safety in Nepal, we provide a background and historical context of the development of food standards and the regulatory landscape.  While there might be many shortcomings in food safety in the country, it is important to remember that food safety tends to be a lower priority when food security cannot be guaranteed.  In Nepal, millions are food insecure with around a quarter of the nation’s roughly 30 million people living below the poverty line.  Nepal has made great strides in food security, with the country dropping its score in the Global Hunger Index steadily since the turn of the century; from 37.4 in 2000, to 31.0 in 2006, 22.8 in 2012 and a more modest drop to 19.5 over the following eight year period, to 2020.  This now gives Nepal a poverty status ofmoderate.  There is still much work to be done in addressing food insecurity, particularly in the effect of growth stunting, which still effects around 36% of Nepali children.  With such pressing needs to continually improve food security in Nepal, it can be understood that food safety unfortunately takes a lower priority, since hunger and lack of resources like clean water and other necessary requirements to ensure food safety and hygiene is maintained, like refrigeration, are not always widespread, especially amongst the lower socio-economic groups in the population, and the non-urban areas.  Thus, people will do what they can with what they have to feed themselves and their family, even if this means taking a chance and engaging in unsafe and non-hygienic food practices, which are unfortunately no doubt commonplace in some areas.  Despite this, if we can start to at least address food safety and hygiene practices in commercial establishments for a start, then provide resources to make food safety more achievable, then we will start to make progress in ensuring the safety of the food supply in Nepal.Here in this first part, we start of with the historical background and put the food regulatory landscape of Nepal into context.  Then, in parts two and three, we look into what is the current situation and status of food safety in Nepal and then laboratory surveillance, and how that is carried out.  While policy development is one aspect, simply providing resources and awareness to people, in their own homes and understanding their situation and finding ways to bring improvements and empowerment to their food safety practices, is another area that we, asFood Microbiology Academy, are particularly interested in.Earnest government regulation and strategic planning in the agriculture and food area commenced in Nepal during the 1950s with the launch of the First Five Year Periodic Plan in 1956.  There have been successive three- or five-year plans ever since, up to the present day.  This has included the development of core legislation around food production and manufacturing since the mid-1960s when the first Food Act was introduced, in 1966.  This has undergone many revisions over the decades, most notably during the development of the Nepalese constitution in 2015.  In further recognition of the importance of food and agriculture to the nation, the Government of Nepal has launched multiple strategic plans and projects in recent decades to further drive advancements and accelerate progress.  This is due to the fact that the Nepalese economy is still dominated by small-scale agricultural pursuits, the streamlining of which will enhance the quality of life in the nation while contributing to a stimulation of economic growth through efficiency across the entire sector of agrifood industries.  As such, improvements in food security, living standards and the proportion of people living in Nepal under poverty can thus be addressed.  Furthermore, the constitution of Nepal and other relevant policy adoptions within the last five to fifteen years have indirectly contributed to addressing the broad issues of food security and food safety through stipulations of quality measures and minimum citizen expectations in these areas, thus raising standards in the food supply and indeed in the standards of living across the nation.  With the implementation of the 20-year Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS) some five years ago, emphasis has been placed on post-farmgate matters, including the safety and quality of food.  Though the ADS and another associated government initiative, the ten-year Prime Minister Agriculture Modernization Project (PMAMP), measures have been put in place to increase capabilities in food safety and quality, which in turn, increase food security, nutrition and indeed public health across the board.  Ultimately, the Government of Nepal, through it’s Department of Food Technology and Quality Control which was established in 1961, provides a legislative-based framework to support the food safety aspirations of the nation.  The Food Acts, which originally came into effect 55 years ago, are central to upholding the standards of food safety and quality in Nepal, which are developing strongly and contributing to economic growth and lifestyle improvements across the nation.","food microbiology, Food safety, food science, food security, foodborne disease, microbiology, nepal, poverty"
Public health,"bacteria, food-safety, public-health",Genetic control of the bacterial adaptive acid tolerance response.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/genetic-control-of-the-bacterial-adaptive-acid-tolerance-response/,"September 1, 2021","In 1998 and 1999, at what is now the Mount Helen campus of Federation University in Ballarat, Victoria, I completed my Honours degree in food science, submitting my thesis on 16 July 1999 and graduating in May the following year.  My thesis was in the area of bacterial physiology, specifically on the adaptive acid tolerance response in two key food borne disease bacteria – the Gram negativeEscherichia coliand the Gram positiveStaphylococcus aureus.  Many physiological mechanisms may contribute to this acid tolerance response, which has much significance in food manufacturing and indeed the virulence of these bacteria, which ultimately, makes this physiological phenomenon of public health significance too.  An increased acid tolerant state may offer enhanced survival in low pH foods and aid subsequent gastric passage, enabling proliferation further along the gastrointestinal tract.  Thus, the adaptive acid tolerance response is considered a virulence factor as it contributes to pathogenesis.  In this blog article, I want to cover just two of the (genetic) bases for an adaptation to extremes and normally lethal pH values.  Please note though that my thesis was submitted in July of 1999, and therefore this piece of writing covers the knowledge in this area up to that date only.4.7.2 GenesA number of genes have been identified which directly or indirectly assist bacteria in their attempt to survive low pH conditions.  With S. typhimurium, at least 17 genes have been identified(Foster, 1995).  These are reviewed byFoster (1995).  Of these, two genes,rpoSandfurwill be discussed further.Some genes, present in a variety of bacterial species, are widely accepted as regulators of inducible acid tolerance, such asrpoSand probablyfur.  However, some specific genes may play an essential role in the inducible acid tolerance of certain bacteria, for example,actAinRhizobium meliloti(Tiwari et. al., 1996).4.7.2.1rpoSgeneTherpoSgene is a member of a group of genes that enable survival under a range of extreme conditions.  A related gene, also widely researched (Huang et. al., 1998;Emetz and Klug, 1998), isrpoH, required for the heat shock response ofE. coli.Cheville et al. (1995)have demonstrated the vital nature ofrpoSin a variety of acidic conditions, including fermented meat, and in addition, found that the stationary phase RpoS protein gave tolerance to heat and salt.Salmonellahave also been shown (through gene cloning experiments) to requirerpoSto tolerate acid(Lee et. al., 1995)while similar observations have been made withBacillus subtilis(Hecker and Volker, 1998).  More importantly, the alternative sigma factor encoded byrpoSand the subsequent acid shock proteins, such as RpoS, induced a sustained ATR rather than just a transient induced tolerance to acid(Lee et. al., 1995).  They have shown that induction of the transient ATR can occur without RpoS but for the cells to survive beyond 20min in low pH, RpoS is required.  The central role played by therpoSgene has been clearly demonstrated in a number of species by the construction of mutants lacking this gene.  These species includeS. flexneri(Waterman and Small, 1996)andS.Typhimurium(Wilmes-Risenberg et. al., 1997).  As well as enabling survival in extreme heat, salt and acid, alternate sigma factors (in this situation, alternate sigma factor 54) can also function in times of nitrogen deprivation of the cell via the generpoN, as described byLewin (1994).  While these groups of genes are responsible for enabling survival in a variety of stress responses, rpoS itself can provide general stress protection against diverse environmental conditions.  For example, inPseudomonas aeruginosa,rpoSincreases resistance up to three-fold against heat, low pH, high osmolarity, hydrogen peroxide and ethanol(Jorgensen et. al., 1999).4.7.2.2 fur geneResponsible for iron uptake, thefur(ferric uptake regulator) gene has been shown byLee et. al. (1995)to be necessary for a transient ATR inS.Typhimurium whileFoster and Hall (1992)describe the contribution of the Fur protein to expression of fur as “extensive”.Bagg and Neilands (1987)describe the action of Fur and state that the most obvious means of action is that transcription offuris repressed by Fur binding to Fe, which reversibly attaches to the operator sequence.  Perhaps unexpectedly, the ATR function of Fur is not induced by iron with both systems (iron acquisition and ATR) acting independently of each other(Hall and Foster, 1996).S.Typhimuriumfurmutans demonstrate the importance of this gene as shown by the work ofFoster (1993)who has shown that afurmutant was unable to induce pre- or post-shock acid adaptation and also byWilmes-Riesenberg et. al. (1996)who found that this mutant had reduced virulence as the LD50 (in mice) was higher, up to a 3-log increase.  Although not a direct mutation infur,Foster and Bearson (1994)have shown thatS.Typhimurium mutants with mutations inatrDandatrF(these mutations affect iron metabolism and regulation) are acid-sensitive.  They state that this supports the idea of the involvement of Fur-regulated genes in inducible acid tolerance.",
Public health,"bacteria, food-safety, probiotics-and-gut-health, public-health",Antibiotic misuse and overuse,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/antibiotic-misuse-and-overuse/,"February 19, 2021","Antibiotics, discovered and commercially developed in the 1930s, have gone from being hailed as ‘magic bullets’ in 1940s human medical practice to nearly a scourge of humanity today, through decades of overuse and misuse in human and veterinary medicine.  As the World Health Organization states, they really do pose a big public health threat, across the world (Figure 1).  Despite being the foundation of ‘miracle’ cures in the early days, those gains in the war against human bacterial diseases are starting to unravel and are at serious risk of being reversed.  Not only that, but residual levels of antibiotics present in the food supply, resulting from widespread use in the agricultural environment has posed additional threats to human health.  These represent another facet of food safety, apart from the more common microbial food safety, which has wide-ranging public health consequences.  Seemingly, the lack of understanding around the molecular genetics of antibiotic resistance development and consumers’ comfort level with antibiotics, means that the general public appears to have very little concern for the environmental, personal health and public health consequences of antibiotic overuse and misuse.  Interestingly, the same people are quite possibly staunchly opposed to genetic modification in agriculture, which has no safety concerns, yet are comfortable with antibiotics, despite their negative impacts on the environment and on humanity.  In this article, I want to focus on the effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiome and the subsequent negative on that may arise for one’s personal health, which may or may not be able to be rectified through consumption of probiotic foods.  A further consequence could be increased susceptibility to foodborne disease.Figure 1: Antibiotic resistance is a significant public health issue across the planet.One’s gut microbiome, which develops shortly after birth, is a delicately balanced ecosystem of specific bacterial species characteristic of that individual.  While some generalisations can be made, the finer aspects are unique to each of us.  Overall, we still have much to learn and understand about the human gut microbiome (Iizumi, 2017).  However, what we are increasingly gaining an acknowledgement of, and indeed an appreciation for, are the diverse impacts good gut health may have for it’s host.  Conversely, the negative consequences of disruption to our specific balance of bacterial species can have serious detriment.While antibiotics are indeed ‘wonder drugs’ capable of eliminating or stopping the growth of many bacteria, there are downsides.  I’m not just talking about contribution to the devastation of antibiotic resistance prevailing in the world, or the side effects to antibiotic therapy an individual can experience, but to the disruption or sometimes decimation to one’s gut microbiome that may result during a course of antibiotics.  These are potentially big problems of a personal nature for us.It is acknowledged that the gut microbiome, and in fact our natural flora in other parts of the body, plays diverse positive roles in our personal health.  Originally this was thought to be localised, and so consumption of probiotics to ensure gut microbe balance was to have an impact on digestive health.  While this is certainly true, there’s an increasing appreciation of the wide effects.  Not only on physical health, but on mental health too – more information in thisblog articleI wrote towards the end of 2020.So with such a potential wide impact from disruption to one’s gut microbiota, how can we help our ‘friendly’ bacteria to help us?  Keeping personal antibiotic use to an absolute minimum is one way by simply saying no to antibiotics and exploring alternatives (Figure 2).  I for one, have not had to treat an infection of mine using antibiotics since 1990.  The comprehensive review paper (Ferreret al., 2017) on the topic of how the functioning of the gut microbiome is negatively impacted by antibiotic therapy reviews several studies that have demonstrated just how bad antibiotics are for our gut microbiota.  These authors cover numerous references to studies demonstrating the general reduction in total gut bacteria and also for specific taxa.  The complex diagram presented in Figure 3 shows how particular gut bacteria and negatively effected by antibiotics.  This really does highlight the magnitude of the (growing) problem around adverse effects on personal health of antibiotic therapy.Figure 2: Say NO to antibiotics.Figure 3: Complexities of how antibiotics negatively impact bacteria of the gut microbiome.  Source: Ferreret al.(2017).Despite this negativity, there are some interesting opposing results.  Martín-Núñezet al. (2019) found that the significant changes to the gut microbiota in human subjects with antibiotic therapy forHelicobacter pyloriinfection improved host glucose homeostatis.   So it’s not all doom and gloom, but that doesn’t mean we should be encouraging an imbalance of one’s gut microbiota!  Furthermore, Raymondet al. (2016) raises an interesting finding that although negative impacts to the gut microbiome composition take place, they are predictable and with knowledge of an individual’s original gut microbiome profile.Despite the above consequences in the human context, the fact remains that agricultural use of antibiotics accounts for the vast majority of antibiotic sales, in the US (Figure 4).  With the rapidly developing interest in plant-based foods, this will hopefully become less of a problem, but certainly, the absolute dominance of antibiotic use in the context of veterinary medicine as compared with human medicine, is yet another reason to consider plant-based dietary options.Figure 4: Use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine dominates over human medicine.So where does that leave us?  Antibiotics have a place, and if they are used for their intended purpose then it is unlikely we would be in the predicament we find ourselves in now.  Therefore, we all need to contribute and play our part to halt the deleterious effects on our personal health and on our public health by refusing to be part of antibiotic overuse and misuse.ReferencesFerrer, Manuel, Méndez-García, Celia, Rojo, David, Barbas, Coral, & Moya, Andrés.

Public health,"bacteria, public-health",The raw milk debate,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-raw-milk-debate/,"September 26, 2020","For many decades, since the later part of the 19th century in fact, debates have been intense about raw milk and its heat treatment and the pros and cons of it all.  Just to be clear that I’m not going to use any references in this article – with the voluminous amount of studies in the scientific literature on this topic, a huge literature review can easily be done, and I’m assuming many scholarly literatures have been written on this topic.  However, I’m choosing to not go down that path, rather write from my experience, my understanding and my perspective on this all-important topic, one that is almost continuously debated – yes, one hot topic indeed!  So, let’s get into it…First of all, a definition.  While the word “milk” has been used to refer to plant juice type products for many hundreds of years, in this case, I’m using the word milk to refer to the mammary gland secretion of adult female domesticated animals, most often bovine, but of course this various in different parts of the world.Cattle themselves, the pasture environment or indoor cattle accommodation in colder climates in winter along with the milking environment are certainly not the most hygienic places (Figure 1).  Animals, their faecal matter and mud is a combination that is certain to promote an unhygienic environment.  Thus, it is not surprising therefore that (raw) milk can and does harbour pathogenic micro-organisms (Figure 2) and milkborne disease was a significant public health issue.  Consequently, Louis Pasteur (Figure 3) is considered one of if not the most prominent scientist in the field of microbiology.  It is he who developed the preservation technique that bears his name – pasteurisation.  Originally developed for wine, it was applied to milk in an attempt reduce the terrible mortality and morbidity that came from drinking bovine milk raw, as was the case in those days.  I could write much about the history of pasteurisation, it’s introduction to the dairy industry and the debates in those early decades about how to protect public health yet provide a nutritious product.Figure 1: A dairy cattle farm shed.Figure 2: Some of the pathogenic bacteria that can be lurking in raw milk.Figure 3: Louis PasteurSo what are the two sides today?  Much the same really, it’s just that we have a different situation, scenario or norm now with most milk heat treated or otherwise processed for safety compared to a hundred years ago when most milk for human consumption was still raw, especially in the UK.  As a food microbiologist, my instant response regarding human consumption of raw milk is that it is always unsafe and should never be done, despite the many benefits that are claimed (Figure 4).  However, I read a review of a book (Figure 5) on Amazon recently which actually analysed such a response by a recent PhD graduate in his consumer-orientated book on food science questions.  While it is true that I would never drink raw milk myself (well, I never drink dairy milk at all anymore as I am now vegan), it is actually impossible to say if it is always unsafe.  The fact is, without microbiologically testing it, we just wouldn’t know.  Another fact is that pathogenic microorganisms are not that common, so the likelihood of their presence in a given sample of raw milk is very low – however, without testing that milk, they could be there, and all it takes are a few cells sometimes, or some temperature abuse perhaps, and you have an out of control population of pathogenic bacterial cells on the verge of causing disease in an unsuspecting raw milk drinker.  So while a given raw milk sample might be safe to drink, without testing it, we don’t know now.  Therefore, the risk can never be zero under such circumstances and therefore, raw milk must never be drunk unless there is an iron-clad guarantee as to is safety, which is pretty much impossible.Figure 4: Claimed benefits of drinking raw milk.Figure 5: The book (or more accurately a review of this book) which prompted me to write this blog article.It is true that heat treatment negatively impacts the nutritional quality of food, and milk too, but be aware of some people or groups making outrageous claims (Figure 5) that are incorrect.   The personal and public health consequences of raw milk consumption are just not worth the extra nutritional benefit from raw milk.  There are many safer food sources of those nutrients, or simply drink heat-processed milk, which will give you less of those nutrients, which you could make up from another source.Figure 6: Pasteurisation does not eliminate all nutrients in milk.Now, there’s another argument that raw milk advocates sometimes raise, especially if they have a dairy farm background, and it is that they or their family or friends have been drinking raw milk for years or for decades and never got sick.  Valid point, for sure.  This just shows the fact that pathogenic microorganisms are in fact rarely encountered.  Of course, the other possibility is that they did get ‘gastro’ and didn’t (or don’t want) attribute it to the raw milk.To sum up here – milk is indeed a highly nutritious food/drink.  Furthermore, there’s no denying the fact that heat treatment of raw milk, applied for safety reasons and to increase shelf-life, does have a detrimental effect on the nutritional quality.  My verdict is that because there is always a risk of foodborne disease from raw milk (unless one can guarantee it being free from microorganisms, which is impossible from a practical perspective), it should never be consumed.  There’s no point in taking an unnecessary risk.  Better to simply seek alternative dietary sources of those nutrients you are seeking from (raw) milk.I encourage challenge to my perspective, so let’s continue the debate in the comments section!","food microbiology, Food safety, foodborne disease, raw milk"

A few weeks ago, I started moving our video content to our new Brand YouTube channel, with the first (and so far the only!) video on our channel being  on my career in food microbiology.  In fact, this video formed the basis of our vlog posted on May 24, which is located here:http://foodmicrobiology.academy/2020/05/24/my-food-microbiology-career/.So anyway, a few days ago my video was found by a (very) young aspiring food microbiologist in Mumbai, India.  This teenage student made some comments to initiate a conversation with my around career advice and guidance, then we continue our discussions through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.  Now, we’re about to formalise our discussions with a mentoring agreement.  This is just great news and of mutual benefit as she can clearly gain from my years on a non-traditional career path and I real feel like I’m ‘giving back’ and encouraging and ‘grooming’ the next generation of passionate food microbiologists to come along and really take on the challenges of the world and solve them, which we can all really achieve together.  This student is pretty amazing because even at her young age, she has a career vision and a firm goal of wanting to work in the area of food safety and foodborne diseases at the World Health Organization.  With such a plan at such an early age, she can so get there as well.  What I wanted this blog post to be was to introduce the career mentoring thatFood Microbiology Academynow offers by elaborating on some of the examples I provided to this mentee during our early discussions.Firstly, too many people, myself included years ago in the mid to late 1990s, have a general career idea but no firm goal and vision.  Without this, you do almost wander aimlessly to some extent.  Thus, I would say – don’t worry about or try and identify what you will study as your undergraduate degree and where until you have identified your dream job.  Then, you can work backwards.  Setting your dream job as your goal will help answer so many questions, such as:Which is the highest degree I’ll need?Do I need to do a Master degree?  if so, should it be a research or coursework Master degree?Which country should I complete my various degrees in?What should my undergraduate degree be in?What sort of opportunities should I seek during holidays or internships to support me reaching my career goal(s)?For example, if you have come to the conclusion that you need a PhD, does the Australian (three years, one laboratory, research only) or North American (four years, laboratory rotations during the first year, 25% coursework) model work better for you and your career.  Then, for training like a PhD, the importance of factors that you should consider can be ranked like this, from most important to least important: Supervisor > Laboratory > Department > University > Country.  Some people get to hung up over doing their PhD in a particular country or a particular university.  However, it is the supervisor that is most critical and I’m sure you can find exceptional academic supervisors leading world-class research groups engaging in cutting edge discoveries located in what many would consider sub-standard universities or lower ranking countries for research training or higher education in general.However, you may not even be at the stage where you can identify your ideal or dream job, but you just have a hankering for food microbiology.  In such case, perhaps consider the following, as a non-exhaustive list of careers in food microbiology that require high levels of responsibility, so senior positions that typical require a PhD:I)Teaching food microbiology in a college/university(professor in a community college).II)Doing food safety research in a university(research-only academic position, like Research Assistant Professor or Senior Research Fellow, in a research-intensive university).III)Teaching food microbiology and doing food safety research in a university(traditional academic position).IV)Doing food safety research and development in a food manufacturing company(only food manufacturing companies of substantial size, like Nestlé would engage in such R&D)V)Consulting and therefore providing advice to small and medium size food companies on keeping their products safe(either as an independent consultant or working for a scientific consulting firm).VI)Managing food safety at a large food manufacturing company(this may be part of a quality management role of if the food manufacturing operation is large enough, then it would be a seperate position).VII)Tracking foodborne diseases and identifying sources of outbreaks(such as at a government health organisation, which could be at a national level like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States or the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory in the Australian state of Victoria)VIII)Developing public health strategies and government policy to reduce foodborne disease(an advisory role in government to assemble scientific information and make recommendations for policy and legislative changes to protect the health of the citizens under the jurisdiction of the government you’re working for).So, if you’re a budding food microbiologist (no pun intended!) or simply want to find out more about careers and working in our field, do contact myself (Dr Philip Button, @pdbutton, by e-mail to philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academy).","career, career choice, food microbiologist, mentoring"
Public health,"bacteria, food-safety, public-health, viruses",Zoonoses and foodborne disease,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/zoonoses-and-foodborne-disease/,"February 11, 2020","The current 2019-nCoV (example image in Figure 1) global pandemic has highlighted the importance of; animal reservoirs (and intermediate animal hosts) of disease, animal origins of human disease and zoonotic diseases and raises (again) the possibility of potential foodborne Coronavirus transmission.  This disease has been postulated to have crossed, probably in late November 2019, from animals to humans at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (Figure 2) in Wuhan, China.  I say postulated, because there are more links between this market and early reported cases of the disease, than not.  In fact, 55% of all cases reported in 2019 (n = 425) had contact with the market (Liet al., 2020).  However, interestingly, the first reported case had no contact with this market.  Thus, an element of doubt exists regarding the degree of involvement of this market.  Anyway, this  huge ‘wet’ market comprises over 1 000 stalls and is a substantial trading area for a multitude of different species of animals, both live and dead.  Most of the trade is for food purposes, i.e. human consumption, but some are for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), where certain body parts of sometimes rare species are used for therapeutic purposes.Figure 1: What Coronaviruses look like.Figure 2: Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China.While the presence of this, or indeed other, viruses in animals sold as food doesn’t constitute a foodborne disease as such, in theory they could very well be a foodborne disease, in addition to their recognition as a zoonoses.  However, the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (2015) has stated that no direct evidence exists for foodborne transmission of the SARS Coronavirus or the H5N1 Influenza virus and that direct contact with animals is the likely means of transfer of these viruses from animals to humans.  Presumably this could be the situation with 2019-nCoV too?  However, Rodriguez-Morales (2020) states “the possibility of foodborne transmission from animal derived matter which has recently been highlighted to influence the current epidemic”.  Certainly, the potential for foodborne transmission is there but they would probably get stopped in their tracks, so to speak, during cooking, since viruses tend to be rather heat sensitive.Figure 3: Some bacterial zoonotic diseases.All this got me thinking and investigating online about zoonoses in general, and I was reminded that many, many diseases are in fact zoonotic (Figure 3).  I forgot that HIV/AIDS was (is?) a zoonoses that originated in a non-human source.  Many other common diseases, including recognised foodborne disease are zoonotic as well.  In fact, typically the two most common foodborne diseases in many parts of the world, infection fromCampylobacterand fromSalmonella, are considered zoonotic infections.  These of course, primarily originate from poultry flocks, with occurrence so widespread that it is safer to regard or poultry and poultry products (for example eggs) as contaminated, than non-contaminated.  Fortunately from the perspective of public health, these bacteria have low heat resistance and are easily eliminated by standard cooking procedures.  By and large, the same could be said for viruses present in animals as food sources.  However, while the temperature for viral inactivation might be similar to bacteria, they rate of inactivation is seen to be slower.  Therefore, a pasteurisation process may not be effective in eliminating viruses like it is for elimination of bacteria.Figure 4: Scene at a wet market in Wuhan, China.

The original caption on flickr reads “To the left are the still alive rabbits, in the middle are the skins from the already sold ones-skin for sale as well at that stage, and to the right are two halves of fresh killed rabbit for sale. All for only 17 RMB per kilo. Source: https://www.flickr.com/photos/cookiesound/9637285106Another aspect to consider is the complexities of managing the microbial or disease-free status of animals that are sold as food.  In western countries, where the palate might be regarded as simpler, a rather limited number of animal species are reared for food purposes.  The vast majority of animal meat consumed probably comes from a limited number of species, most of which are farmed (rather than wild caught) under tightly controlled and regulated agriculture or aquaculture environments.  This enables the farmer and government regulators to closely monitor disease status and in turn, act swiftly if something is amiss with regard to the health status of the animals which might post a threat to human health.  With such controls, regulation and monitoring in place, foodborne disease outbreaks still occur that can be traced back to primary production.  Imagine then, in a market where a myriad of animal species are sold – some alive and some dead, some wild-caught and some from small-scale family farms (Figures 4 and 5).  With less knowledge and less understanding of the disease status of the animals, the presence of asymptomatic infections and how to manage any risks, one would think this situation poses an almost insurmountable task with regard to personal safety, food safety and indeed public health.  For example, we just really don’t know what is going on with wild animal reservoirs of human disease (Figure 6) and indeed, the animal origins of human disease.  As we are not (and from a practical perspective, cannot do so) monitoring wild animal populations for their disease status, or asymptomatic infection status, we just don’t know what viruses, bacteria or protozoan parasites they are harbouring and how they are mutating and if and when they might cross the species barrier to other animal species or humans.Figure 6: Some animal reservoirs of some human diseases.It seems there are many sources of the problem, with Liet al.(2020) raising another when they state that positive attitudes towards the consumption of wild-caught game meat is at the root of the problem.  Regardless, I feel that this 2019-nCoV situation reminds us to be vigilant – there is much we don’t know about virulence and pathogenesis of infectious diseases and even when we have controls, monitoring and regulations in place, anything can still go amiss, simply because we’re dealing with an unpredictable dynamic biological system.  Therefore, as a global community let’s work together, let’s contribute together, let’s share together!ReferencesAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food Adhoc Group on Foodborne Viral Infections.

Uncategorized,uncategorized,"Food safety regulations of the world – Part 3, Europe",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-safety-regulations-of-the-world-part-3-europe/,"June 8, 2023","Yesterday, June 7, was World Food Safety Day.  The World Health Organization has stated this year’s theme was “Food standards save lives”.  To provide an introductory overview of the food safety regulatory framework around the world, we are giving an overview each day this week of the food safety regulations in the three most populous countries on each inhabited continent.  This is part 3 of 6, Europe, where we look into Russia, Germany and the United Kingdom.Food safety regulations in Russiaare enforced by several government bodies, with the Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor) playing a key role. Here are some key aspects of food safety regulations in Russia:Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing (Rospotrebnadzor):Rospotrebnadzor is the main regulatory authority responsible for food safety in Russia. It oversees and enforces food safety regulations to protect public health.Licensing and Certification: Food businesses, including producers, processors, distributors, and retailers, are required to obtain licenses and certifications from Rospotrebnadzor to operate legally and ensure compliance with food safety standards.Food Safety Standards and Guidelines: Rospotrebnadzor establishes and enforces food safety standards and guidelines, covering various aspects such as hygiene practices, handling, processing, storage conditions, labeling, and packaging requirements.Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor):Rosselkhoznadzor is responsible for overseeing the safety and quality of animal and plant products, including meat, dairy, and agricultural produce. It works in collaboration with Rospotrebnadzor to ensure overall food safety in Russia.Federal Customs Service (FCS):The FCS regulates the import and export of food products in Russia. Imported food must meet Russian food safety standards and undergo inspection and testing before being granted entry.Food safety regulations in Germanyare robust and enforced by various government authorities at the federal and state levels. The primary regulatory bodies responsible for food safety in Germany include the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL), Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL), and the state-level food control authorities. Here are some key aspects of food safety regulations in Germany:Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (BMEL):The BMEL is responsible for formulating policies and legislation related to food safety in Germany. It establishes the legal framework and sets the overarching guidelines for food safety.Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL):The BVL is the central authority responsible for coordinating food safety at the federal level. It collaborates with state-level authorities to ensure consistent implementation of food safety regulations across Germany.Risk Assessment and Management: The BVL conducts risk assessments and provides scientific advice on food safety matters. It assesses potential risks associated with foodborne hazards, contaminants, and additives, and recommends risk management strategies.State-Level Food Control Authorities:Each state in Germany has its own food control authority responsible for enforcing food safety regulations within its jurisdiction. These authorities conduct inspections, monitor compliance, and enforce food safety standards at the local level.Food Safety Standards and Regulations:Germany adheres to strict food safety standards, including the EU food hygiene regulations. These regulations cover various aspects of food production, processing, handling, storage, and distribution to ensure the safety and quality of food products.Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP): Food businesses are expected to implement GHP and HACCP systems to ensure hygiene, traceability, and risk management throughout the food production chain.Food Labeling and Transparency:German food safety regulations emphasize accurate and transparent labeling of food products. Manufacturers must provide clear information on ingredients, nutritional content, allergens, and proper storage instructions. Special labeling requirements exist for organic, genetically modified, and allergenic substances.Food Safety Inspections and Monitoring:The state-level food control authorities conduct regular inspections and monitoring of food establishments, including farms, processing facilities, restaurants, and retail outlets. These inspections assess compliance with hygiene standards, handling practices, traceability, and documentation.Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF):Germany participates in the RASFF, a European Union system for rapid information exchange on food safety issues. It enables quick communication and cooperation among member states in case of food safety incidents, recalls, or cross-border issues.Consumer Education and Awareness:German authorities, including the BMEL and state-level agencies, promote consumer education and awareness on food safety. They provide information and guidance to consumers on safe food handling practices, allergens, and understanding food labels.Compliance with food safety regulations is essential for food businesses in Germany to ensure the safety and quality of their products and protect public health. The collaboration between federal and state-level authorities and the emphasis on risk assessment, inspections, and transparency contribute to a robust food safety system in Germany.Food safety regulations in the United Kingdomare established and enforced by several authorities, with the primary responsibility lying with the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and local authorities. Here are some key aspects of food safety regulations in the UK:Food Standards Agency (FSA):Food Safety Act 1990: The Food Safety Act is the primary legislation governing food safety in the UK. It sets out the general requirements for food safety, including provisions for food hygiene, labeling, and the enforcement of regulations.Food Hygiene Rating Scheme: The FSA operates the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme, which rates food establishments based on their hygiene standards. These ratings are displayed publicly, enabling consumers to make informed choices about where to eat or buy food.Food Safety Management Systems: The FSA encourages food businesses to implement documented food safety management systems, such as Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), to identify and control potential hazards.Local Authorities:Environmental Health Departments: Local authorities in the UK, through their Environmental Health departments, are responsible for enforcing food safety regulations at the local level. They conduct inspections, provide advice to businesses, and take enforcement action when necessary.Food Inspections and Audits: Local authorities carry out routine inspections of food establishments to ensure compliance with food safety regulations. They may also conduct audits of food businesses to assess their food safety management systems.Food Safety Regulations:Food Hygiene Regulations: The Food Hygiene (England) Regulations 2013 (or their equivalent regulations in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) provide detailed requirements for food hygiene practices in food businesses. These regulations cover areas such as personal hygiene, food handling, cleaning, and temperature control.Food Information Regulations: The Food Information Regulations 2014 (as amended) specify requirements for food labeling, including allergen information, nutrition labeling, and country of origin labeling.Food Standards:Food Standards: The FSA establishes standards for food products, including limits for contaminants, food additives, and residues of pesticides and veterinary drugs. These standards aim to ensure the safety and quality of food available in the UK.Food Allergen Regulations:Food Information for Consumers Regulation (EU FIC): The EU FIC, adopted in the UK, requires businesses to provide clear information about allergens present in their food products, including prepacked and non-prepacked foods.Food Safety Training and Guidance:The FSA and local authorities provide guidance and resources to food businesses, including training materials and online tools, to help them understand and comply with food safety regulations.","food microbiology, food regulations, Food safety, food science, food standards, foodborne disease, regulatory affairs"
Uncategorized,"food-quality, uncategorized",Blockchain or bust: A business and science revolution for food microbiology?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/blockchain-or-bust-a-business-and-science-revolution-for-food-microbiology/,"May 3, 2023","Blockchain technology has become a buzzword in recent years, but its origins can be traced back to the early days of the internet. The first blockchain-like concept was introduced in 1991 by two researchers, Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta, who proposed a way to create a tamper-proof digital document by using cryptographic techniques. However, it was not until 2008 that the first practical application of blockchain technology was introduced.In 2008, an unknown person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” This white paper proposed a decentralised digital currency that could be transferred between individuals without the need for intermediaries like banks. The underlying technology used to facilitate these transactions was called blockchain.The first blockchain was created in 2009 to power the Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The blockchain served as a distributed ledger, recording every transaction that took place on the network. The ledger was stored on a network of computers, and each computer had a copy of the ledger, making it impossible for any single entity to alter the record.The early years of blockchain technology were largely dominated by the cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin was the first and most well-known blockchain-based cryptocurrency, but over time, many other cryptocurrencies were created using blockchain technology, including Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin.However, as the technology evolved, people began to realise that blockchain had applications beyond the cryptocurrency industry. Blockchain technology could be used to create secure, decentralised systems for a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, supply chain management, and more.Today, blockchain technology is being explored by companies and organisations around the world. It is still a relatively new technology, and many of its potential applications are still being discovered. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see many more use cases for blockchain in the years to come.Blockchain technology is a digital ledger system that has recently gained popularity in many industries, including the food industry. It offers a decentralised and secure platform to store and manage data, ensuring that information is tamper-proof, transparent, and immutable. Blockchain technology has many potential applications in food microbiology, from food safety to supply chain management. In this article, we will explore the applications of blockchain in food microbiology.Traceability and transparencyOne of the most significant challenges in the food industry is ensuring traceability and transparency. Consumers want to know where their food comes from and how it was produced. Blockchain technology can provide a secure and transparent way to track food products from farm to fork. Each transaction is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable and transparent record of the food’s journey.By using blockchain technology, food producers can create a digital record of their products’ production, transportation, and storage. This record can include information such as the origin of the ingredients, the date and time of production, the location of production, and any quality control checks performed.Consumers can access this information by scanning a QR code or entering a unique product code. This allows them to verify the product’s authenticity, trace its journey, and ensure that it meets their dietary requirements and ethical standards.Food safetyFood safety is another critical issue in the food industry. Blockchain technology can help improve food safety by providing a secure and transparent way to track food products from farm to fork. The technology can be used to track and record the entire supply chain, from the source of the ingredients to the final product.By using blockchain technology, food producers can quickly identify the source of any contamination in the supply chain. This can help prevent foodborne illnesses and reduce the risk of food recalls. In case of any contamination, blockchain technology can enable the rapid and efficient recall of affected products.Quality controlQuality control is an essential aspect of food production. Blockchain technology can help ensure quality control by creating a secure and transparent record of all quality control checks performed on food products. This record can be accessed by all parties involved in the supply chain, including producers, distributors, and retailers.By using blockchain technology, food producers can track the temperature and humidity levels of their products during transportation and storage. This can help ensure that the products are stored and transported under the correct conditions, maintaining their quality and freshness.Payment systemsBlockchain technology can also be used to create secure and transparent payment systems for the food industry. By using blockchain technology, food producers can ensure that they receive fair and timely payments for their products. The technology can be used to automate the payment process, reducing the need for intermediaries and increasing efficiency.By using blockchain technology, food producers can also reduce the risk of fraud and other financial crimes. The technology can be used to create a transparent and immutable record of all financial transactions, making it difficult for fraudsters to manipulate the system.Intellectual property protectionIntellectual property protection is essential in the food industry. Blockchain technology can be used to protect the intellectual property of food producers, such as their recipes and formulations. By using blockchain technology, food producers can create a secure and transparent record of their intellectual property, making it difficult for others to steal or copy their products.ConclusionBlockchain technology offers many potential applications in food microbiology. By using blockchain technology, food producers can ensure traceability and transparency, improve food safety, ensure quality control, create secure payment systems, and protect their intellectual property. As the technology continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see more and more applications of blockchain in the food industry.","blockchain, food industry, food manufacturers, food microbiology, Food safety, food science, quality control"
Uncategorized,uncategorized,"The ton is up, number one hundred.",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-ton-is-up-number-one-hundred/,"February 28, 2023","My first foray into blogging was between October and December in 2016, where I wrote several posts, around ten I believe, on various topics in food science and agriculture. It wasn’t until July 2019, that I restarted my blogging endeavours, but this time on travel.  Between July and December of that year I wrote 15 travel blog articles, before putting my travel blog on hold.  I relaunched it this month actually, which is super exciting.  However, on 12 December 2019, I wrote my first blog article on food microbiology.  Today, on the last day of February in 2023, I post the 100th article on my food microbiology blog.  What a journey it has been, largely through the COVID-19 pandemic too.In this super special, big milestone article, I want to write about generative artificial intelligence.  This super amazing form of AI is really taking the world by storm of late, ruffling some feathers, but also making others very excited about what lies ahead and the potential of our future with AI.  Really, at its most fundamental, it is a tool.  It’s a tool that humans can use, so they can spend their time and their own intelligence and mental capability on other areas.  It offers a revolution, if we are willing to accept it.This year, we published six blog articles here at Food Microbiology Academy.  All of these have largely been written by ChatGPT.  Is this cheating? Is this unethical?  Not at all.  Generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT are here, and not only are they here to stay, but they are rapidly getting more powerful.  While most of the words were written by ChatGPT, the words didn’t write themselves.  It needed human input, to prompt it to write, and then the output needed review, evaluation, editing and then compiling neatly into an article with a logical flow.  First of all, the article came about because I had a thought about a topic and I then had to offer the most appropriate prompts to get the most appropriate outputs.  It’s one of those ‘rubbish in, rubbish out, concepts.  The actual generation of the text was one part of the whole process, a part which now can be handled by AI.  Human involvement is still substantial – we haven’t got to the point yet where a blog can be connected to an AI platform to generate it’s own SEO blog articles with images and post them!  Until those days arrives, the human brain still has a lot of work to do with regard to maintaining and progressing a blog.  It’s just that now, text can typically be written by generative AI, or can it?While I have been raving about how AI systems can write the text of blog articles, there are certainly some topics where this just can’t be done.  In science-based blogs where the focus is on sharing of facts and some limited general opinion, then generative AI is perfectly suited.  Thus, the articles contained in this blog, on food microbiology and related topics, are really well suited to writing by AI, with myself ‘packaging’ the raw output of words from ChatGPT into a form that is a (relatively!) polished blog article.  Now, in addition to my food microbiology blog, I also blog on travel.  Most of my travel blogs are first-hand experiences about places, the food and local places for example.  I also blog about itineraries, what to do, where to go and the best things to see.  Most of these must be written by myself as they are not so much facts, rather my views and perspective.  As I said above, I’ve relaunched my travel blog this month, and yet to actually post any new content, rather, I have relaunched my previous 15 blog articles.  However, I have various posts in draft about experiences, first-hand experiences about eating, taking flights, experiencing attractions and so on.  These have been written by myself, there’s really no other way to do it.  However, for at least some of these posts, I plan to start off with some AI-generated text of a general nature.  What I mean by this is topics like history or climate.  These are facts and can be easily written by AI to set the scene and give some general information about a city or region.  Then I go into my experience(s) there.In summary and to conclude – AI is here, and it is an amazing tool that we need to embrace.  It can do so much for us and has so much potential to do so much more.  Use it to make your life easier, so you can spend more and more time doing something else.  This really is a sudden godsend, freeing up time that can now be spent on any number of other activities.  Jump on the generative AI bandwagon and reap the benefits instead of spending time writing copy!","ai, artificial intelligence, blogging, copywriting, food microbiology, futuristic, generative ai"
Uncategorized,uncategorized,Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeasts,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/physiology-and-biochemistry-of-food-spoilage-yeasts/,"February 13, 2022","This is a (slight edited) extract of a lengthly literature review written by a 3rd-year food science and technology student, Doreen Ting, at RMIT University in 2008 – I (Dr Philip Button) was her project facilitator.  The overall literature review is excellent, and despite its age, at 14 years old now, it will still serve a purpose as a review of the fundamental elements of key food spoilage yeasts.  On 5 January 2020, we published a blog article as part 1 in this series, giving an overview of the significance of yeasts in this context.  We won’t label this and subsequent articles as parts, but shall provide links to them, and to a separate document which contains all the literature cited.IntroductionYeast are of particular interest to food microbiologists due to the significant economical losses they cause to the food and beverage industry. There are several species, which are of particular concern includingZygosaccharomyces rouxii(Martorell et al., 2004; Steels et al., 1999) andZygosaccharomyces bailii(Martorel et al., 2004; Vermeulan et al., 2008). These yeasts are characterised by their ability to survive, and indeed thrive, in normally hostile environments (Encyclopaedia of Food Microbiology 1999, p. 2359; Makdesi & Beuchat, 1996). These conditions include low pH, low water activity (aw), high levels of preservatives, and high osmotic pressure. Their ability to tolerate stress conditions has been, ad still remains, of major concern to the food industry.Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) ofZygosaccharomyces bailii.Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeastsYeast are unicellular fungi in which asexual reproduction occurs mainly through budding. According to Frazier & Westhoff (2005), although species of yeasts may differ considerably in their physiology, those of industrial importance have enough physiological characteristics in common to allow generalisation. This is inclusive of both beneficial and detrimental yeast species, bearing in mind regardless, both group of yeast may still have different physiological characteristics depending on their relationship to the food industry, which will later be understood in this review.Most microorganisms grow best in environments with vast amounts of moisture. Yeast however prefers environment with high concentrations of solutes such as sugar or salt. Majority of bacteria do not possess the ability to grow in such conditions unlike yeast. Yeast grows in food with water activity level ranging from 0.88 to 0.94 (Frazier & Westhoff, 2005). However, one particular species has the ability to grow at a water activity level as low as 0.62 (Frazier & Westhoff, 2005; Martorell et al., 2004), which isZygosaccharomyces.In general, most yeast grow in the temperature range of between 25 °C to 30 °C, with some having heat tolerance of up to 75 °C (Thomas & Davenport, 1985). In addition, majority of yeast favours acidic conditions with a pH range of 3.0 – 7.0 (Fleet, 2006). Nevertheless, some generaare able to grow at a pH of as low as 2.5 (Steels et al., 1999). According to Flores et al. (2000), sugar is an excellent source of energy and carbon for all yeasts. Deak (2008) in being more specific stated that only a few sugars could by fermented by yeasts, which are mostly hexoses and oligosaccharides. The type of sugar most commonly utilised by all known yeast includes fructose (Boles & Hollenberg, 1997; Flores et al., 2000; Levya et al., 1999) and glucose (Boles & Hollenberg, 1997; Flores et al., 2000). In addition to hexoses and oligosaccharides, yeasts are also able to utilise several ‘non-conventional’ carbon sources including fatty acids (Trotter, 2001), pentoses (Flores et al., 2000) and alcohol (Frazier & Westhoff, 2005). The fermentation of sugar by yeast produces alcohol and carbon dioxide and has been the basis for the production of alcoholic beverages and leavened bakery products (Deak, 2008), which is beneficial to the food industry. However, this has also caused unfavourable effects to food, which will be further explained in the review.As mentioned earlier, yeast has exceptional tolerance to stress environments. Extensive research has repeatedly shown resistance of some yeast to certain hurdles, which impart microbiological shelf-stability protection to processed foods. Increasing demand for foods with reduced amounts of chemical additives and less physical damages has increased the need for application of the “hurdle technology” concept in food preservation (Leistner 1995, cited in Palou et al. 1997). Leistner (2000) indicated that the concept of “hurdle technology” is the key to achieving success in food preservation. In this case, hurdles include the use of weak-acid preservatives, low pH, low aw, and high osmotic pressure in controlling the growth of yeast in food products.The yeast genusZygosaccharomycesis the most prominent food spoiler of all genera in the food industry, as three species (Zygosaccharomyces bailii,ZygosaccharomycesrouxiiandZygosaccharomyces bisporus) from this particular genus possess several intrinsic physiological resistance factors, which have caused them to survive in harsh environments, compared to other genera. In some cases, these yeasts are found to be innately resistant to common food preservatives, which includes acetic acid (Steels et al., 2000; Thomas & Davenport, 1985; Warth 1989), lactic acid, propionic acid (Warth 1986), benzoic acid (Cole et al., 1987; Macpherson et al., 2005; Makdesi & Beuchat, 1996; Warth, 1986), sorbic acid (Cole et al., 1987; Macpherson et al., 2005; Thomas & Davenport, 1985), sulphur dioxide (Cole et al., 1987) and ethanol (Encyclopaedia of Food Microbiology 1996, p. 2361) states that the organism utilises an inducible, active transport pump to counteract the toxic effects produced by undissociated preservative molecules (Hazan et al., 2004; Pampulha & Loureiro-Dias, 1989; Raso et al., 1998; Vermuelen et al., 2008) build-up inside individual cells. Exposure to preservatives is expected to cause membrane destabilisation, reduced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production and oxidative damage to cell membranes (Hazan et al., 2004; Piper, 1999). However, due to the mechanism stated earlier, some of these species are able to resist weak-acid preservatives in food products.The metabolism of this particular genus is also distinctive. In this case,Zygosaccharomycesmetabolises fructose more rapidly than glucose compared to most yeast (Levya et al., 1999). In addition, the enhancement of resistance to preservatives was found caused by high sugar levels in food. As mentioned earlier, a pump is used to offset the toxic effects.Links to related articles and to the reference list of literature cited in this and/or related articles.Overall importance and general characteristics of food spoilage yeastBlog article published on 5 January 2020.Food spoilage yeast reference list","food microbiology, food preservation, Food quality, food science, food spoilage, Fungi, mycology, Yeast"

Uncategorized,uncategorized,Key parameters for shelf-life,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/key-parameters-for-shelf-life/,"April 25, 2021","IntroductionFood preservation is generally about incorporation of multiple hurdles (Figure 1) which will either slow microbial growth, stop microbial growth or eliminate microorganisms.  Multiple hurdles are required because of the diversity of microbial contaminants likely to be present in a given food product,  For example, the parameters dictating the growth of yeasts and mesophilic bacteria are quite different.  Different bacteria might be very different in this regard, as could be different yeasts and different moulds from one another.  Therefore, apart from achieving what is known as ‘commercial sterility’ in your product (and even this has exceptions, particularly with regard to spore forming bacteria), no other preservation approach can be used for wide spectrum application against all the ‘troublesome’ microorganism that might be encountered.  Hurdles can generally be classified as intrinsic (factors present within the food) or extrinsic (factors present outside of the food) and the three discussed below are generally the most important for preservation of most food products.  Therefore, these three factors could be reasonably expected to contribute to preservation of many products.Figure 1: Hurdle concept in food preservationTemperature– extrinsic factorMany people will recognise that temperature control is key to extending the keeping quality of food.  This is because, with some exceptions, the micro-organisms that will be most problematic from a safety and quality perspective will grow well within a certain range.  While this range of temperature for optimal growth relatively narrow, at roughly 25 °C to 35 °C, the temperature danger zone is an important concept in food microbiology, where between 5 °C and 60 °C, any contaminating microorganisms can be expected to grow, given long enough.  Important exceptions to this would beListeria monocytogenes, which is a a psychotropic pathogen and variousPseudomonasspecies, such asP. fluorescensandP. fragi, which are psychotropic spoilage bacteria.  Psychrotrophy is a key concept in shelf-life (and is different to microorgniams being psychrophiles – Figure 2), since low temperature storage doesn’t stop spoilage or unsafe food from developing, but merely delays it and in fact selects for the growth of these bacteria.  Therefore, while refrigeration is an excellent means to extend shelf-life, one must be mindful of the possible presence of psychotropic microorganisms and their dominance in refrigerated foods over time.Figure 2: Difference being psychotropic and psychrophillic growth.pH– intrinsic factorThe degree of acidity can be considered on the pH scale, with different microorgiansms growing at different pH values and over a different range of pH values (Figure 3).  An important consideration of intrinsic product hurdles to microbial growth is that not all hurdles that appear the same, are the same.  For example, there are significant differences in the environment when different acids are used as acidulent.  Therefore, a pH of 3.0 or 4.0 will have variation in severity with regard to its antimicrobial capabilities when an inorganic or organic acid is used.  Of course, only organic acids are permitted in foods, but even with organic acids, there are variations between common types.  Citric acid permits growth of microorganisms down to a pH of 2.1, but if acetic acid is the acidulent, then the minimum growth pH is 2.9 – a most significant difference of 0.8 of a pH unit, especially when one considers the pH scale is logarithmic.  Interesting research findings of Juven (1976) illustrate this: an acid-tolerant canned fruit spoilage species,Lactobacillus brevis, was tested in media with different acids to effect the same pH.  When citric, hydrochloric, phosphoric and tartaric acids were used, this species could grow to a pH of 3.0.  However, when lactic acid was used to lower the pH, no growth occurred below pH 3.7 while with acetic acid being used to lower the pH, the minimum growth pH was 4.0.Figure 3: pH range for microbial growth.Water activity– intrinsic factorWater activity, designated aw,is another key growth determinant, but one which, for the majority of foods, is irrelevant because most foods have a level of water that allows microbial growth to occur.  To briefly outline, water is present in two forms – bound and unavailable or unbound water that is freely available for microbial growth.  The measure of the amount of unbound and freely available water is water activity.  This is different from  moisture, which is the total amount of water in a product, in this context.  Most foods have a high water activity, and this is what most microorganisms require.  However, similar to the situation that can occur with pH, once the water activity drops to a relatively low level, and growth of the majority of microorganisms is inhibited (Figure 4), growth of those that are able to grow in those low water activity levels is selected for.  In many cases, the organisms that can grow at low pH can also grow at low water activity, so a juice concentrate is therefore particularly suitable for them, especially when competition is removed in the form of many bacteria, which are fast-growing in comparison and would otherwise outcompete mould.  Addition of salts (for example sodium chloride) or sugars (for example sucrose) is the standard means to alter water activity in manufactured foods.  Thus, the action of concentration of a substrate by removing available water, leads to a decrease in water activity through concentration of the salts or sugars present.Figure 4: Minimum water activity for microbial growth.ReferenceJuven, B. J. (1976).

Viruses,"bacteria, public-health, viruses",Emerging pathogens in the food supply chain: A growing concern for global health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/emerging-pathogens-in-the-food-supply-chain-a-growing-concern-for-global-health/,"April 13, 2024","In today’s globalised world, the food supply chain is more interconnected than ever before. This interconnectedness, while beneficial for meeting the dietary demands of a growing population, also poses significant risks in the form of emerging pathogens that can quickly spread across borders. Understanding the dynamics of these pathogens, their impact on public health, and the measures needed to mitigate their threats is crucial for ensuring food safety.The nature of emerging pathogensEmerging pathogens are defined as microbes that have recently appeared within a population or those whose incidence or geographic range is rapidly increasing. In the context of the food supply chain, these can include bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi that contaminate food products and cause illness in consumers. Examples of such pathogens that have had significant impacts on public health includeE. coliO157:H7,Salmonella, andListeriamonocytogenes, among others.These pathogens can enter the food supply chain at various points, from production and processing to distribution and retail. Changes in agricultural practices, environmental factors, global trade, and even consumer preferences can influence the emergence and spread of these pathogens.Factors contributing to the rise of emerging pathogensSeveral factors contribute to the rise and spread of emerging pathogens in the food supply chain:Globalisation of food supply: As food travels longer distances to reach global markets, there is increased risk of contamination at multiple points along the supply chain. Different regions may have varying standards for food safety, complicating the management of foodborne pathogens.Intensive farming practices: High-density farming provides ideal conditions for the rapid spread and mutation of microbes. The use of antibiotics and pesticides can also contribute to the development of resistant strains of pathogens.Climate change: Changing climate conditions affect the habitats of many organisms, including pathogens. Increased temperatures and altered precipitation patterns can lead to the proliferation of foodborne pathogens and extend their geographical range.Consumer preferences: The demand for organic and raw foods has increased. While these foods are often perceived as healthier, they may also bypass some of the processing steps designed to eliminate pathogens, thus posing additional risks...Case studies of emerging pathogensSeveral outbreaks have highlighted the risks associated with emerging pathogens in recent years:E. coliin leafy greens: Repeated incidents ofE. colicontaminations in romaine lettuce have led to significant illness across several states, prompting widespread recalls and re-evaluation of farming and processing practices for leafy greens.Listeria in frozen vegetables: A multinational outbreak of Listeria linked to frozen vegetables affected several countries in Europe, leading to long-term changes in the processing, freezing, packaging, and storage of frozen products.Hepatitis A in pomegranate seeds: An outbreak of Hepatitis A associated with pomegranate seeds imported from Turkey affected several people in Australia, emphasising the need for better control of imported foods.Mitigating the risksControlling the spread of emerging pathogens in the food supply chain requires a multi-faceted approach:Enhanced surveillance and reporting: Early detection of outbreaks through improved surveillance and rapid reporting systems can help in quickly identifying the source of contamination and preventing the spread of disease.Strict regulatory standards: Implementing and enforcing stringent food safety regulations both domestically and internationally can help minimise the risk of contamination. Standards should be based on scientific evidence and regularly updated to reflect the changing nature of pathogens.Advanced detection technologies: Investing in newer and more precise detection technologies can help identify pathogens at lower concentrations and with greater accuracy, before the contaminated products reach the consumer.Consumer education: Educating consumers about safe food handling practices and the risks associated with certain types of foods can reduce foodborne illnesses. Simple practices, such as washing hands and surfaces often, can prevent the spread of bacteria.Cooperation and communication: Effective communication and collaboration among governments, industry stakeholders, and international bodies are essential for managing the risks associated with foodborne pathogens. Sharing information about outbreaks and best practices can help improve the overall safety of the food supply chain...ConclusionAs the world becomes more interconnected, the challenge of emerging pathogens in the food supply chain will only grow. Proactive measures, including advanced research, robust surveillance systems, international cooperation, and consumer education, are crucial to safeguard public health. By understanding and managing the risks associated with these pathogens, the global community can work towards a safer, healthier food supply for everyone.","Food, food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, health, microbiology, nutrition, supply chain"
Viruses,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, food-quality, fungi, viruses, yeast",50 facts about food microbiology!,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/50-facts-about-food-microbiology/,"June 26, 2023","Food microbiology is the study of microorganisms that interact with food, including bacteria, viruses, yeasts, molds, and parasites.Microorganisms can be both beneficial and harmful to food. Beneficial microorganisms are used in processes like fermentation and production of certain foods, while harmful microorganisms can cause foodborne illnesses.Bacteria are the most common microorganisms associated with food spoilage and foodborne diseases.Some common bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses includeSalmonella,Escherichiacoli(E. coli),Listeriamonocytogenes, andCampylobacter.Viruses, such as Norovirus and Hepatitis A, can also contaminate food and cause foodborne illnesses.Yeasts and molds are responsible for food spoilage and can affect the texture, flavor, and appearance of food.Microorganisms can contaminate food at various stages, including during production, processing, transportation, and storage.Foodborne illnesses can result from consuming contaminated raw or undercooked food, improper food handling and preparation, cross-contamination, and inadequate storage temperatures.Temperature control is crucial in preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms. The temperature danger zone for food is between 4 °C (40 °F) and 60 °C (140°F).Pasteurisation is a process that involves heating food to a specific temperature to kill or inactivate harmful microorganisms, while retaining the food’s quality.Fermentation is a process that uses beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, to convert sugars into alcohol or acids. Examples include yogurt, cheese, sauerkraut, and pickles.Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, provide health benefits. They are often found in fermented foods and are known to promote gut health.Food preservation techniques, such as canning, drying, and freezing, aim to prevent or slow down the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.Good hygiene practices, including proper handwashing, cleaning and sanitizing of surfaces, and maintaining personal hygiene, are essential in preventing the spread of microorganisms in food.Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a systematic approach used in the food industry to identify and control potential hazards related to food safety.Foodborne illnesses can have various symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and in severe cases, organ failure or death.Proper cooking temperatures are critical to ensure the elimination of harmful microorganisms. For example, poultry should reach an internal temperature of 74 °C (165 °F), while ground meat should reach 71 °C (160 °F).Cross-contamination can occur when raw foods come into contact with cooked or ready-to-eat foods, potentially transferring harmful microorganisms. Separate cutting boards and utensils should be used for raw and ready-to-eat foods.Some food products undergo a process called aseptic packaging, which involves sterilizing the food and packaging materials separately and then filling the sterile food into sterile containers.The pH level of a food product can influence the growth of microorganisms. Most bacteria prefer a neutral pH around 7, while some acid-tolerant bacteria can grow in low-pH environments.Food poisoning is a type of foodborne illness caused by the ingestion of toxins produced by certain bacteria, such asStaphylococcusaureusandBacilluscereus.Food intoxication occurs when the ingestion of food contaminated with live microorganisms leads to illness. Examples includeSalmonellaandCampylobacterinfections.Food allergies are immune responses triggered by specific proteins in food. They are not caused by microorganisms but can be influenced by cross-contamination or improper labeling.Botulism is a severe form of food poisoning caused by the toxin produced by the bacteriumClostridiumbotulinum. It can result from improperly canned or preserved foods.Fermented dairy products, such as yogurt and kefir, contain beneficial bacteria known as probiotics, which can contribute to a healthy gut microbiome.The use of antibiotics in livestock can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can potentially be transmitted to humans through contaminated food.The development of rapid diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing, has revolutionised the detection and identification of microorganisms in food.Food microbiologists often work closely with food scientists, food safety experts, and regulatory agencies to ensure the safety and quality of food products.Food recalls can occur when a product is found to be contaminated with harmful microorganisms or other hazards. They are initiated to protect public health.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, are used in the production of alcoholic beverages through the process of fermentation.Foodborne pathogens can survive and multiply in refrigerated environments, emphasising the importance of proper storage temperatures and practices.Cross-protective adaptations can occur between different microorganisms in food, where the presence of one microorganism inhibits the growth of another.Food fermentation can enhance the nutritional value of foods by increasing the availability of certain vitamins and minerals.Some moulds produce mycotoxins, which are toxic compounds that can contaminate food. Examples include aflatoxins, produced byAspergillusmolds, which can be found in nuts, grains, and spices.Biopreservation is a technique that uses naturally occurring microorganisms or their products to inhibit the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in food.The microbial composition of food can vary depending on factors such as the source of the food, processing methods, and storage conditions.Some beneficial bacteria, such as those in the genusLactobacillusandBifidobacterium, are commonly used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products.Foodborne illness outbreaks can occur when multiple people experience similar symptoms after consuming contaminated food from a common source.Food safety regulations and guidelines differ among countries and are often based on risk assessments and scientific evidence.The use of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) is being explored as a potential alternative to antibiotics for controlling bacterial pathogens in food.Some microorganisms, such as those in the genusSaccharomyces, are used in bread making and contribute to the fermentation process, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and alcohol.High-pressure processing (HPP) is a non-thermal food preservation technique that uses high pressure to inactivate microorganisms while retaining the nutritional value and quality of food.Microorganisms can form biofilms on food contact surfaces, making them more resistant to cleaning and sanitising agents.The presence of certain microorganisms, such asPseudomonasspp., can accelerate the spoilage of fresh produce.Foodborne illnesses can have significant economic impacts, including medical costs, loss of productivity, and damage to the reputation of food manufacturers.The study of foodborne pathogens and their transmission routes is essential for developing effective control strategies to prevent foodborne illnesses.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, can produce enzymes that enhance the flavor and texture of food products.Food safety training and education are vital for food handlers and consumers to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure proper food handling practices.Microbial testing is commonly used in the food industry to monitor the quality and safety of food products.Ongoing research in food microbiology aims to develop novel methods for microbial control, improve food preservation techniques, and enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and food.","food microbiologist, food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Viruses,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, food-safety, fungi, viruses, yeast",The Food Safety Modernization Act: Transforming Food Safety Practices in the USA,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-food-safety-modernization-act-transforming-food-safety-practices-in-the-usa/,"June 7, 2023","Today, 7 June 2023, is World Food Safety Day, a day the World Health Organisation has set aside to focus on failings in food safety and to celebrate achievements in food safety.  This year’s theme is about how food standards in food safety save lives.  There’s no doubt that they do.  When one looks back to the 19th century, even, or maybe especially, in the the great industrialised nations of the modern world, up and coming food manufacturers, either out of ignorance or deliberately, manufactured foods that were certainly not in the public’s best interests.  While we don’t have the level of morbidity and mortality we once did, there’s no doubt that foodborne disease represents a totally unacceptable high amount of illness, death and economic burden in our communities.  What makes it even more difficult to understand is that foodborne illness is largely preventable, through the following of procedures, processes and protocols that have been developed following rigorous basic scientific research.  Thus, food standards at all levels (local, state, federal), play an absolutely critical role in safeguarding the food supply of a nation.In this article, we want to focus on the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), a turning point in food safety in the United States that came into being only 12 years ago.IntroductionFSMA, enacted in 2011, is a landmark legislation that revolutionized food safety practices in the United States. Designed to address the challenges posed by an increasingly complex and global food supply chain, the FSMA introduced a comprehensive framework to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure the safety of the nation’s food supply. This article examines the key provisions of the FSMA, its impact on the food industry, and the strides made in safeguarding public health through enhanced preventive measures and regulatory oversight.Overview of the FSMAThe FSMA shifted the focus of food safety in the USA from reactive measures to a proactive, preventive approach. It empowered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the authority to set stringent standards and regulations across the entire food supply chain, from farm to fork. The act encompasses several key components, including preventative controls, inspections, import safety, response to outbreaks, and enhanced partnerships.Preventive controlsOne of the cornerstones of the FSMA is the establishment of preventive controls to identify and address potential hazards before they can cause harm. This includes the implementation of Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) by food facilities. HARPC mandates a systematic approach to evaluate and prevent biological, chemical, and physical hazards in food production, processing, and distribution. It requires food manufacturers to develop and implement comprehensive food safety plans, conduct regular risk assessments, and institute preventive measures.Inspections and complianceThe FSMA introduced a risk-based inspection strategy to ensure compliance with food safety standards. It provided the FDA with increased authority to conduct inspections, sampling, and testing of food facilities. The act also mandated the establishment of a third-party certification program, enabling accredited auditors to assess and certify compliance with the FSMA requirements. Non-compliant facilities can be subject to corrective actions, penalties, and even product recalls if necessary.Import safetyRecognizing the importance of imported foods in the American market, the FSMA strengthened the FDA’s oversight of imported food products. It mandated the development of a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP), which places responsibility on importers to verify that their foreign suppliers meet U.S. safety standards. The act also granted the FDA authority to refuse entry to imported goods from non-compliant facilities and increased the frequency of inspections for high-risk products.Outbreak response and partnershipsIn the event of a foodborne illness outbreak, the FSMA equipped the FDA with enhanced tools to respond swiftly and effectively. It established a food tracing system to track and trace products throughout the supply chain, enabling rapid identification of the source of contamination. Furthermore, the FSMA emphasized collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies, as well as industry stakeholders, to share information and resources and foster a culture of proactive food safety practices.Impact and challengesThe FSMA has had a profound impact on the food industry, leading to improved food safety practices and reduced foodborne illnesses. By shifting the focus towards prevention, the act has encouraged proactive measures, such as better recordkeeping, increased training, and improved sanitation practices. However, implementing the FSMA’s requirements posed challenges for smaller farms and food facilities due to resource constraints and compliance costs. To address these concerns, the FDA has provided educational resources, technical assistance, and flexibility in certain compliance deadlines.ConclusionThe Food Safety Modernization Act has transformed the landscape of food safety in the USA. By prioritizing prevention, enhancing regulatory oversight, and fostering collaboration, the FSMA has made significant strides in safeguarding public health and strengthening consumer confidence in the nation’s food supply.

Viruses,"prions, viruses",What is life?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/what-is-life/,"April 16, 2022","Classification oflifeBiology is the study of life.  Once upon a time, there were just two types of lifeforms, animals and plants.  If something wasn’t clearly an animal, well, it  was classified as a plant, which included fungi, algae and even bacteria.  Today, we can see the errors in judgement of this two category system for which the science of biology was named and founded.  Today though, with great advancements in taxonomy based on molecular biology, the distinctions between these various lineages are very clear.  However, that is for what we can neatly and completely classify as life.  The grey areas of recent biology are in the microbiological world, not prokaryotic cells, but even smaller than that, the complex aggregations of chemicals that sit at the interface between life and non-life.  Are they extraordinarily complex aggregations of chemicals or extraordinarily simple forms of life?  It is open to debate, and a fascinating one it is.  We start our discussion below by considering what life is, then covering an overview of prions, viroids and viruses as the three biological entities, infectious biological entities, that appear not to fit the definition of life, at least not as we currently know and define it.Criteria for lifeA fascinating aspect of biology is delving into the criteria of what is life.  What are living and non-living entities in the biological world?  Animals, plants, fungi and the various Protisan macro- and microorganisms are quite obviously life, as are Bacteria and the other forms of prokaryotic life, the Archaea.  However, where does that leave the sub-cellular biological entities that are not capable of free existence?  Parker (1953), inAmerican Scientist41:614, said that four (main) criteria defined – growth, movement, reproduction and metabolism.  Certainly, these are a bit vague, like for example what does “movement” mean?  Does that mean plants are non-living as they don’t fulfil these criteria?  It is an interesting debate, a debate that has been complicated with the discovery and in-depth analysis of biological entities that fit few of the criteria of life, yet are dominant in their specific ecological niche.  Earlier, it just just viruses, but then the discovery of viroids and subsequently prions, has just really opened up a whole new world of parasitic relationships and indeed, has really redefined parasitism.Really though, should we care? should it bother us? is this purely of academic, scholarly interest only and something that has not practical value in the “real-world”?  Perhaps, yes, but the natural world, and it’s categories have always been an important way or ordering what we see.  This started of course with Linnaean taxonomy, based on phenotypic differences, which has led to molecular-based differentiation.  Ordering the natural world, the biological world, allows a systematic investigation and therefore one would think, a more thorough analysis of the significant challenges that each one of these presents to humanity, either directly or indirectly.Direct impact can of course be human disease, but then we have indirect impacts through economic losses of agricultural crops or livestock.  Thus, these sub-cellular biological entities that sit at the boundary between living and non-living have certainly been able to wreak substantial chaos on humanity.PrionsPrion diseases are a group of rare, fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and animals.Prion diseases are caused by an infectious agent called prions. Prions are misfolded proteins that can cause other proteins to misfold in the same way.  They are the only known biological agents that can replicate themselves without a nucleic acid template in the host cell. The disease is transmitted when people or animals eat food contaminated with the prion protein.The most common form of human prion disease is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD affects about one person per million each year worldwide. It usually starts with personality changes, difficulty walking, and problems with coordination. As the disease progresses, mental function becomes impaired and involuntary jerking movements may appear. Death usually occurs within a year of diagnosis, often from respiratory or cardiac failure.ViroidsA viroid is a type of virus that infects plants. Viroid infection can cause stunting, wilting, and yellowing of the plant.Viroid infection can be caused by a number of different types of viroid. The most common type is the potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd). This viroid is transmitted by aphids and causes the potato to produce misshapen tubers.VirusesA virus is a small infectious agent that can only replicate inside the living cells of other organisms. Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea.Viruses consist of two or three parts: genetic material made from either DNA or RNA; a protein coat called a capsid; and sometimes an envelope of lipids that surrounds the virus. The genetic material inside the virus may be single-stranded or double-stranded DNA or RNA. The capsid is made from proteins and sometimes contains materials like metal ions which give the virus its shape. The envelope is made from lipids (fats) and proteins, but no genetic material.Viral diversity","biology, microbiology, taxonomy, viroids, virology, virus"
Viruses,"food-spoilage, public-health, viruses",Saving the world,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/saving-the-world/,"January 18, 2022","Outline of problems of the world, where we are with them and how microorganisms may help.As much as humans believe they can do anything, and essentially effect total control over the world, the biosphere and our planet, we have a major global pandemic put everything into perspective for us.  This demonstrates how the unseen can exert near total control, how an entity that doesn’t even satisfy the criteria to be classified as a form of life, can wreak catastrophic havoc.  However, the microbial world must not be seen as evil, for it is the delicate balance in our biosphere, driven by microorganisms that has not only brought stability our world for billions of years, but gradually allowed a myriad of lifeforms to evolve and flourish.  Despite the resilience of the microbial-stabilised biosphere, our planet must not be taken for granted.  We have assumed the role as the current custodians of our planet and are privileged with the responsibility of ensuring it remains habitable, not just for our species, but for as many species’ as possible.  This requires an acknowledgement of the key role of microorganisms in this aspect, through their fundamental contribution to energy and nutrient cycling along with their base position in many food webs, especially those in aquatic biomes, which cover around three quarters of our planet.  The absolute fundamental contribution of microorganisms to sustainable agriculture and hence food production and food security through stabilisation of climatic deterioration and biospheric harmony not only requires acknowledgement, but action.  We can do this, we are all in this together, what we must all do our part to keep this world habitable, then to improve our planet and ultimately, to ensure the longevity of our planet in the face of mounting challenges.  The answers to do all this lie with microorganisms, from a multitude of perspectives – newly developed probiotic and/or fermented manufactured foods, regenerative agriculture, restriction of antibiotic use in livestock, to name some of the ways that microorganisms can contribute to widespread improvements in our world.Society appears to have reached the stage where traditional scientific approaches may not be able to sustain humanity into the future.  Not only does technology need to continue progressing, but so do people’s mindsets and attitudes.  These are key to furthering society as in many instances throughout history, advances have been limited by resistance from consumers, the general public, who have staunch beliefs and attachments to their traditions and what they are familiar with.  However, the general public must move past this, because these technologies of the future (and even technologies of the past, that have met with untold resistance) are needed to advance humanity, in fact, putting it simply, for society to have a chance of addressing the immense global challenges in the space of agriculture and food, policy makers will need to be able to select from any (safe) technology that is available.  Two that come to mind are food irradiation for food preservation and recombinant DNA technology for development of crops able to better provide food for the continued boom in population growth expected over the coming decades.  Both of these, are in some form, associated with microbiology.What are the big problems of the world?  Furthermore, can we predict what might be global or significant regional challenges that we haven’t encountered yet?  Perhaps not.  Look at the ongoing impact of COVID-19.  In the late 2000s, Barclay (2008) provided insights into attempts to predict future pandemics.  Not long after that, yet another influenza pandemic swept the world and then, 10 years on from that pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 emerged.  It is easy to say that humanity is at the mercy of infectious disease, but even if the science was equal to the task, there are complex social and political considerations at play, many of which stem from traditions, attachments and the generally strong mindsets and attitudes that are not easy to shift.  A way to address this, is perhaps, two-pronged.  Involvement of the general community in so-called ‘citizen science’ projects along with sustained consumer awareness campaigns carried out in parallel.There’s no doubt food in general is at the cornerstone of humanity’s issues.  Whether this be food security, improving yield, reducing spoilage and food waste, farming marginal lands or combating foodborne disease, these are all major contemporary issues.  If any of these could be successfully addressed, just one, it would be a miraculous achievement for humanity.  They do present seemingly insurmountable hurdles to society, but there are answers, science really has the potential to answer them and especially so microbiology.  How can this be?  Furthermore, is it really that easy and how can we be sure that microbiology has the answers?  Of course we cannot, but the microbial world has provided, has had many solutions to humanity, over millennia.  There have been profound solutions, solutions to problems that have changed the course of humanity – take antibiotics.  Solutions so significant that they are still practiced to this day, under the same that they were thousands of years ago, for example fermented food products.  Microbiology, and the answers it has given and revolutions it has helped develop are amongst the most significant over the entire course of human history.  Therefore, the secrets of the microbial world are just waiting to be unlocked, explored and from there, we may just discover many tools that will save humanity, solve the challenges of the world and perhaps, again, change the course of humanity.ReferenceBarclay, E., 2008.

Bacteriophage, or phage for short, are viruses of bacteria, meaning that bacteriophage therapy is a biological control concept, and is a natural approach to combat bacteria.  As phage, like all viruses, are non-living entities, meaning they don’t fulfil the criteria for life, they are dependent on bacteria for their survival.  Therefore, no (bacterial) host cells, no phage.  Thus, it is impossible for them to proliferate out of control.  While bacteriophage therapy for human infectious disease dates back around a hundred years at its peak, a newer concept is phage-based biocontrol of foodborne pathogens and bacterial spoilage microorganisms.  This would tick all the boxes for a safe and effective, natural approach to handle the public and economic burden of foodborne disease, plus the economic losses associated with the growth of spoilage bacteria.

Viruses,"food-safety, viruses",Food safety and COVID-19,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-safety-and-covid-19/,"January 1, 2021","https://www.facebook.com/1466359001/videos/10225398926387890/On 12 December 2020, I delivered my invited presentation to the Nepalese Association of Victoria during the second and final  session of their food safety and nutritional wellbeing webinar series – many thanks are extended to Dr Yakindra Timilsena from the Association for the invitation.During the first session of this webinar series on October 31, I presented on general food safety precautions plus the early data that was available on retention of activity/infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.  The data which was just coming out in this area during August to October was pretty preliminary and light-on indeed.  However, fast-forward to November and December, and we have more solid evidence available to strengthen the possibility of COVID-19 being a foodborne disease.  Admittedly, some of the available data is so new and recent it is still in the pre-print stage of the publication process, but there are some interesting findings nevertheless.  The most significant I feel is the data which indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of surviving or remaining active for 21 days, not only at 4 C or -20 C, but even as low as -80 C.  This is a very significant finding indeed for the global food supply chain, which relies on a cold chain as a key food preservation approach, yet, this very approach might actually be preserving the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 and spreading COVID-19 around the world.  So, there is certainly mounting evidence that it is theoretically possible, just very challenging to demonstrate in a practical sense across international jurisdictions.  However, as a result of the evidence, due consideration certainly needs to be given to this transmission route as a possibility.  Previously the best evidence available demonstrated that this virus was able to withstand standard (domestic) freezing conditions in human milk for 48 hours – a most significant result indeed back in August.  However, the most recent finding shows that it can really happen – survival on food products long enough to cross international border in freight supply chains.My contribution to this webinar session (accessible by the link above) was 23 minutes and 42 seconds in duration.

Viruses,"food-safety, viruses",Is it gastro or COVID-19?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/is-it-gastro-or-covid-19/,"September 2, 2020","The disease COVID-19 caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 continues its stranglehold on planet Earth – killing thousands daily, infecting hundreds of thousands daily while doing untold economic and social damage the world over.  This era has never seen anything like, and are unlikely to see anything like it.  It is unprecedented.  Despite the substantial volume of scientific, medical and public health literature on the topic, and which continues to emerge, they fact remains that the disease only became (publicly) known to the world in December 2019 and the causal agent only in January 2020.  Thus, it is still very much a ‘new kid on the block’ when it comes to infectious agents, compared toYersinia pestis, responsible for the deadliest pandemic in human history that killed between 75 and 200 million between 1346 and 1353.  However, there is evidence thatY. pestiswas present as early as 3000-3500 BC, with its first recorded pandemic occurring sometime between 550 and 750.  Therefore, the rapid pace at which knowledge accumulation of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 is occurring is unprecedented, and truly unbelievable.  Despite this, there are many aspects that we don’t know, and that lack of understanding contributes, no doubt, to the continued rapid spread of this disease .It is clear that COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease and that SARS-Cov-2 is primarily a respiratory virus.  Indeed, this viruses name shows how closely related it is to the virus responsible for the SARS epidemic nearly 20 years ago.  Despite these undeniable facts, there are a range of other symptoms and clinical presentations that have been reported (Figure 1), other than the standard fever, dry cough, headache, breathing difficulty etc.  Some of these include gastrointestinal involvement (Linet al., 2020), continuing to fuel speculation over alternative route(s) of transmission.  I written two previous articles on this topic, here on this blog.Figure 1: COVID-19 can clinically present in several ways.The first one, titled “COVID-19: A likely foodborne disease“, written on March 15, was a theoretical speculation into if SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted person-to-person through food.  This could orginally be from respiratory secretions, or maybe even a faecal-oral route.  Considering that SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from wastewater (Ahmedet al., 2020) and the virus has been detected in patient’s faeces up to five weeks after they become negative for SARS-CoV-2 (Wu et al., 2020) the facecal-oral route (Figure 2) is a distinct possibility.Figure 2: How the faecal-oral route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission might occur.  Source: Heller et al. (2020) https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138919Then on April 5, I delved into the how COVID-19 could be regarded as a gastrointestinal disease with the article titled “GastroCoronavirus“.  This was due to the various reported cases where gastrointestinal symptoms appeared first (Figure 3) and were dominant (Figure 4), and in some cases, were the only symptoms.Figure 3: Your COVID-19 symptom could be diarrhoea.Figure 4: Dominance of gastrointestinal symptoms in some COVID-19 patients.Most recently in my blog post published on August 17 titled “The global supply chain transmission possibility of SARS-CoV-2“, I discussed how it may be possible for SARS-CoV-2 to remain viable on frozen food or it’s packaging, long enough to transmit disease on the other side of the world.  This was raised as a possibility of how COVID-19 cases flared up again in New Zealand – the virus remained active on frozen food or its packaging while being shipped from Melbourne (the current epicentre of COVID-19 in Oceania) to Auckland.What sparked me to write another article on this topic area?  Basically a news story yesterday titled “Weird new symptom of COVID-19“, where a healthcare worker in Brisbane suspected from their gastrointestinal symptom (abdominal pain), that they may have been infected by SARS-CoV-2.  They got tested and their subscription was correct – positive!  What I want to point out is that while it is clearly atypical, it is not necessarily a “weird” symptom as the media described (Figure 5) it as – it, gastrointestinal symptoms, has been described before.  This of course raises speculation again whether COVID-19 is a foodborne disease, if the virus can remain active in food, packaging or environmental sources and indeed if a facial-oral transmission route does occur, as it does for many foodborne diseases.Figure 5: The news story which came out of Brisbane yesterday.Where does that leave us?  Despite government and health authorities continuing to state that COVID-19 is not a foodborne disease (Figure 6), I believe these facts warrant a reconsideration of such a conclusive statement.  The facts being:Some people infected with SARS-CoV-2 do develop gastrointestinal symptoms.  In such people, it is not uncommon for these symptoms to be dominant and to precede respiratory symptoms.SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated hardiness, remaining active on various surfaces and in various environments for prolonged periods.  This includes frozen drinks.SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from wastewater, suggesting that a facecal-oral route of transmission is not out of the question.SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from frozen food samples imported from a country many thousands of kilometres away.Figure 6: Official Twitter circulated information from the Government of South Australia in Adelaide.A foodborne route could be a valid transmission mechanism for SARS-CoV-2.  In fact, as early as 27 March 2020, the journalGutaccepted a commentary article for publication, where the authors concluded that the evidence for common occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms is accumulating (Ng & Tilg, 2020).   The fact that relatively few reports on this exist could be because it is substantially underreported because health and government authorities do not (wish too?) recognise that COVID-19 may be a foodborne disease.  This may be one factor contributing to its largely unchecked spread in some countries – people don’t recognise that foodborne transmission is possible, therefore they take few precautions in that regard and with few controls in place, virus transmission by that route continues almost unhindered.  Furthermore, when people have gastrointestinal symptoms, COVID-19 is probably the last thing they would think of.  What did I eat last night? a few days ago? etc., it’s rarely or never, “goodness me, I have such and such a gastrointestinal symptom, I might have COVID-19, let me get tested immediately”. This is just not something people would think.  Therefore, the spread of the disease might further spread, much more easily.  This would be especially so in countries with poor sanitation and hygiene, limited running water and a general lack of understanding or practices related to food safety and/or personal hygiene.So, just be a little more careful with your own practices of food safety and personal hygiene, that episode of “gastro” just may be your first symptom of COVID-19.ReferencesAhmed, W., Angel, N., Edson, J., Bibby, K., Bivins, A., O’Brien, J.W., Choi, P.M., Kitajima, M., Simpson, S.L., Li, J. and Tscharke, B., 2020.

A few weeks ago, I started moving our video content to our new Brand YouTube channel, with the first (and so far the only!) video on our channel being  on my career in food microbiology.  In fact, this video formed the basis of our vlog posted on May 24, which is located here:http://foodmicrobiology.academy/2020/05/24/my-food-microbiology-career/.So anyway, a few days ago my video was found by a (very) young aspiring food microbiologist in Mumbai, India.  This teenage student made some comments to initiate a conversation with my around career advice and guidance, then we continue our discussions through Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.  Now, we’re about to formalise our discussions with a mentoring agreement.  This is just great news and of mutual benefit as she can clearly gain from my years on a non-traditional career path and I real feel like I’m ‘giving back’ and encouraging and ‘grooming’ the next generation of passionate food microbiologists to come along and really take on the challenges of the world and solve them, which we can all really achieve together.  This student is pretty amazing because even at her young age, she has a career vision and a firm goal of wanting to work in the area of food safety and foodborne diseases at the World Health Organization.  With such a plan at such an early age, she can so get there as well.  What I wanted this blog post to be was to introduce the career mentoring thatFood Microbiology Academynow offers by elaborating on some of the examples I provided to this mentee during our early discussions.Firstly, too many people, myself included years ago in the mid to late 1990s, have a general career idea but no firm goal and vision.  Without this, you do almost wander aimlessly to some extent.  Thus, I would say – don’t worry about or try and identify what you will study as your undergraduate degree and where until you have identified your dream job.  Then, you can work backwards.  Setting your dream job as your goal will help answer so many questions, such as:Which is the highest degree I’ll need?Do I need to do a Master degree?  if so, should it be a research or coursework Master degree?Which country should I complete my various degrees in?What should my undergraduate degree be in?What sort of opportunities should I seek during holidays or internships to support me reaching my career goal(s)?For example, if you have come to the conclusion that you need a PhD, does the Australian (three years, one laboratory, research only) or North American (four years, laboratory rotations during the first year, 25% coursework) model work better for you and your career.  Then, for training like a PhD, the importance of factors that you should consider can be ranked like this, from most important to least important: Supervisor > Laboratory > Department > University > Country.  Some people get to hung up over doing their PhD in a particular country or a particular university.  However, it is the supervisor that is most critical and I’m sure you can find exceptional academic supervisors leading world-class research groups engaging in cutting edge discoveries located in what many would consider sub-standard universities or lower ranking countries for research training or higher education in general.However, you may not even be at the stage where you can identify your ideal or dream job, but you just have a hankering for food microbiology.  In such case, perhaps consider the following, as a non-exhaustive list of careers in food microbiology that require high levels of responsibility, so senior positions that typical require a PhD:I)Teaching food microbiology in a college/university(professor in a community college).II)Doing food safety research in a university(research-only academic position, like Research Assistant Professor or Senior Research Fellow, in a research-intensive university).III)Teaching food microbiology and doing food safety research in a university(traditional academic position).IV)Doing food safety research and development in a food manufacturing company(only food manufacturing companies of substantial size, like Nestlé would engage in such R&D)V)Consulting and therefore providing advice to small and medium size food companies on keeping their products safe(either as an independent consultant or working for a scientific consulting firm).VI)Managing food safety at a large food manufacturing company(this may be part of a quality management role of if the food manufacturing operation is large enough, then it would be a seperate position).VII)Tracking foodborne diseases and identifying sources of outbreaks(such as at a government health organisation, which could be at a national level like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States or the Microbiological Diagnostic Unit Public Health Laboratory in the Australian state of Victoria)VIII)Developing public health strategies and government policy to reduce foodborne disease(an advisory role in government to assemble scientific information and make recommendations for policy and legislative changes to protect the health of the citizens under the jurisdiction of the government you’re working for).So, if you’re a budding food microbiologist (no pun intended!) or simply want to find out more about careers and working in our field, do contact myself (Dr Philip Button, @pdbutton, by e-mail to philip.button@foodmicrobiology.academy).","career, career choice, food microbiologist, mentoring"
Viruses,viruses,The global food supply chain transmission possibility of SARS-CoV-2,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-global-food-supply-chain-transmission-possibility-of-sars-cov-2/,"August 17, 2020","The foodborne transmission possibility of SARS-CoV-2 is an ongoing debate.  It has resurfaced in the past week, with some interesting findings and speculation coming out of China and New Zealand.  This time, it’s not so much about the virus’ ability to be transmitted through food, but rather its very low temperature survival on food/beverages and food packaging.  The idea is that SARS-CoV-2 may remain active, or be reactivated, a period of time later, at a distant location from the original contamination site, with very low temperature distribution and storage of food products facilitating its dispersal around the globe.  Let’s try and shed some further light on this topic.Food and health authorities, such as Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) have continued to state that food and food packaging is not at an elevated risk of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, such as inthis adviceon the FSANZ website dated 1 May 2020.A recently published paper by Olaimatet al.(2020), which was received for publication on 5 May 2020, accepted for publication on 15 July 2020 and published on 4 August 2020, states that no studies thus far have investigated survival of the virus on food.  This seems a HUGE oversight, to say the least.  Considering eating is a must for people and that food manufacture, preparation, storage and distribution are considered essential services, it would only seem natural to confirm or eliminate food and food packaging as possible transmission sources.  Thus we actually have no idea, only speculation, regarding the foodborne transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2.  Nearly eight months after the pandemic reported, and no confirmation on how possible foodborne transmission is.So, what are the news stories that (re)sparked this debate?Well, around two months ago, China accused salmon imports from Europe as the source of a COVID-19 cluster in the Beijing, with China’s chief epidemiologist stating that SARS-CoV-2 can survive on the surface of frozen food for up to three months.Seafood industry moves to quash rumors of Beijing’s COVID-19 spike being linked to salmonFast forward to last week, and the re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in New Zealand at an Auckland cold storage facility brought about the idea that the virus may have been (re)introduced into New Zealand on the surface of frozen food imports.Chilling new way virus could be spreading — news.com.auFirst of all we have this one from three days ago, where in China, frozen chicken wings from Brazil tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Shenzhen and frozen shrimp from Ecuador tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Xi’an.  In at least one of these cases, it appears the virus itself wasn’t present – just the RNA was detected.Virus found on frozen chicken wings — news.com.auThen yesterday, further details were provided about a possible link between the origin of this latest outbreak in Auckland at the Americold cold storage warehouse, with an a cluster a few weeks ago at the Amricold cold storage warehouse in Melbourne.Auckland coronavirus cluster grows as virus link to Melbourne investigatedSo what does the science say about this?  We know there is no directly related studies, and information on this topic is generally scant, but this is what we have:Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces appears to be temperature independent (Kratzelet al., 2020).  However, the general consensus in the scientific community is that this virus lasts in an activated and infectious state on inanimate objects for hours or days, not weeks, which is a more likely timeframe when sea transport is involved.  However, the results of Chanet al.(2020) may indicate otherwise, with an inverse correlation between temperature and duration of viability of SARS-CoV-2.  They found at 4 °C, the virus remained viable for in excess of 14 days, with similar high levels of stability at lower temperatures (4 °C) compared with high temperatures, observed by Chinet al.(2020).  Now, this is the big one, which supports these last two studies mentioned above, and this work (Walkeret al., 2020) came out of the University of New South Wales in Sydney, where a study of survival of SARS-CoV-2 in human milk resulted in these extremely important findings, seemingly the only published study of an investigation into survival of this virus under frozen conditions.  So the findings included:Low Temperature Long Time (LTLT) pasteurisation (63 °C for 30 minutes) inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in human milk.Storage of human milk (containing SARS-CoV-2) at 4 °C or -30 °C did not significantly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 over a 48 hour period.With the many studies performed on survival of SARS-CoV-2, only this one paper mentioned just above, published online on 7 August 2020, appear to have considered SARS-CoV-2 survival at temperatures under 4 °C.  This seems a major gap in knowledge, and one which the world would greatly benefit from being filled.  Therefore, it is with great appreciate to this UNSW team that we are starting to gain some direct understanding in this area.  The understanding of long term survival under conditions that would enable the virus to cross international borders with ease would seem critical to developing strategies to combat the spread of the pandemic, or indeed, reseeding of the virus to areas that have COVID-19 largely under control.What can we take from all this?  First of all, despite the great intensity of research efforts into SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 this year, there is of course so much we don’t know.  Therefore, despite national and international health authorities advising of the minimal or negligible likelihood of SARS-Cov-2 transmission via food or food packaging, until (more) research is carried out in this area, especially long(er) duration storage studies at temperatures below 4 °C, including under frozen storage conditions, it needs to be assumed that transmission in this way is plausible and thus practically possible.  This is especially given the seriousness of the disease and the ease of human-to-human transmission.  Therefore, proceed with caution and assume anything is possible until the science says otherwise!ReferencesChan, K-H., Sridhar, S., Zhang, R.R., Chu, H., Fung, A.Y-F., Chan, G., Chan, J.F-W., To, K.K-W., Hung, I.F-N., Cheng, V.C-C. & Yuen, K-Y.

Viruses,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, viruses",Where to obtain maximum probiotic benefits.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/where-to-obtain-maximum-probiotic-benefits/,"August 4, 2020","Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, “immune system” has been a buzzword around us! Recovery from this disease in most cases has largely been reliant on the human body’s natural defence, the immune system. A whopping 70% of our immune system activity is located in our gut. Bacteria in the intestine may help regulate immune cell activity, which allows probiotics to be potentially helpful for supporting immune function. Clinical evidence shows that certain probiotic strains help to prevent bacterial and viral infections, including gastroenteritis, sepsis, and respiratory tract infections.What are probiotics ?Probiotics are “live microorganisms  when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host.” The concept of probiotic bacteria is very old, and is associated with the consumption of fermented foods by human beings, for thousands of years. Recently, new types of food products containing probiotic bacteria have started to be introduced into the market, including non-dairy products, such as chocolate, cereals, beverages, fruits and vegetables products. In the near future, a wide range of non-traditional food products containing probiotic bacteria are expected to be introduced into the market.How Probiotics Act ?As mentioned in an earlier blog article, probiotics have various mechanisms of action. Probiotic microorganisms can be elucidated by promotion of digestion and uptake of dietary nutrients, strengthening of intestinal barrier function, modulation of the innate and acquired immune response of the host, production of antimicrobial substances and competition with pathogens for binding sites. In addition probiotics show adhesion and colonization of the different sites of the human body which may increase their retention time thus providing prolonged probiotic activity.Probiotics  produce substances that inhibit pathogens – low-molecular weight substances – bacteriocins, antibiotics and microcins. Lactic acid bacteria produce a variety of substances that exhibit antagonistic activity against other bacteria.Various Probiotic ProductsDairy probiotic products:-Milk is an excellent medium to carry or generate live and active probiotics through various cultured dairy products. The buffering capacity of milk helps to improve the survival of probiotic flora in the GI tract. Currently hundreds of probiotic dairy products are manufactured and consumed around the world, examples are as follows.Yoghurt– About 80% of the population use yoghurt for direct consumption or as a food supplement daily. A characteristic feature of this product is the addition of starters of pure cultures ofStreptococcus thermophilusandLactobacillus delbrueckiissp.Bulgaricusfor conducting lactic acid fermentation.  These traditional lactic acid bacteria have a positive effect on the body, which is a result of the formed metabolites, which inhibit the putrefactive and pathogenic flora or of the improvement of the utilization of lactose. In last decade many new flavours have been incorporated in yoghurts in order to attract consumers.Ice cream– The incorporation of probiotic cultures into ice cream results in adding value to the ice cream product and it being considered as a functional product. The ice cream composition, which includes milk, incorporating proteins, fat and lactose, as well as other compounds, make ice cream a good vehicle for probiotic cultures. During probiotic ice cream development, the ultimate aim of processes optimization is to enhance and maintain the probiotic survivability, ice cream being relatively high in pH at values of 5.5 to 6.5 leads to an increased survival of the probiotic bacteria upon storage.Cheese– Cheese provides a valuable alternative as a food vehicle for probiotic delivery. Its high protein content provides probiotic bacteria with a good buffering protection against the high acidic condition in the gastrointestinal tract, and thus enhances probiotic bacterial survival throughout gastric transit. Cheddar cheese is a good carrier to deliverEnterococcus faeciuminto the gastrointestinal tract of humans.Kefir– Kefir is a traditional popular beverage consumed for thousands of years in the Central Asia and Middle East countries. It is an acidic-alcoholic fermented milk product, with uniform creamy consistency and a slight sour taste. Milk is fermented with kefir grains, it usually contain lactose-fermenting yeastsKluyveromyces lactis, K. marxianusandTorula kefir.Lactobacillus, Lactococcus,andLeuconostoc; acetic acid bacteria and a further yeast mixture are typical inclusions. Kefir is rich in vitamins B1, B12, folic acid, vitamin K, and biotin, as well as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus.Non-dairy probiotic productsDairy products are the main food carriers for probiotic bacteria to human. Limitations of these products such as the presence of allergens, high lactose and cholesterol contents, and the requirement for cold storage facilities have created the need to look for new probiotic product lines based on non-dairy substrates. Several ranges of non-dairy probiotic products have been developed and marketed in the last two decades.Chocolate– The application of probiotic bacteria into chocolate could offer a good alternative to common dairy products, and allow for broadening the health claims of chocolate-based food products. A chocolate mousse was developed by using probiotic and prebiotic ingredients withL. paracaseisubspecies and with the prebiotic ingredient inulin.Soy based products–  Soybeans are typically high in phytic acid, a plant compound that impairs the absorption of minerals like iron and zinc. Fermentation lowers the amount of phytic acid, which may increase the amount of minerals your body is able to absorb from tempeh and other products. It includes the following products:-Miso–  It is made by mixing soybeans with other ingredients, such as barley, rice and rye. Miso is a good source of protein, fiber and various vitamins, minerals and plant compounds, including vitamin K, manganese and copper.Natto– Natto is a fermented soy product that is a staple in Japanese kitchens. It contains a high amount of vitamin K2, which may help prevent osteoporosis and heart attacks.Tempeh– Tempeh serves as a popular, high-protein substitute for meat. It contains a decent amount of vitamin B12, a nutrient found mainly in animal products.Kombucha– It’s made by adding specific strains of bacteria, yeast and sugar to black or green tea, then allowing it to ferment for a week or more. Kombucha is rich in tea polyphenols and acetic acid, which have both been shown to suppress the growth of undesirable bacteria and yeasts as well as helped prevent the growth and spread of cancerous cells. In the market Kombucha is now available in several fruit flavours.Sourdough Bread– It is an old popular bread which has recently risen to popularity! A recent study showed the market value of sourdough increased from $298.7 million in 2014 to $2.4 billion in 2018. Sourdough bread may not seem that different from regular bread, however the fermentation process breaks down some of the gluten, and that makes it more digestible, especially for people who struggle to digest gluten. It helps to keep your gut bacteria happy, and may be less likely to spike blood sugar levels.",

Therefore, there’s no doubt that microbiologists are particularly valuable at the moment.  Especially virologists and those microbiologists that have an understanding of infectious diseases, public health and/or epidemiology.  Plus, some knowledge of immunology can be helpful to for vaccine development as can pharmacology for drug development.  However, it’s really the microbiologists that are coming to the fore.  People talk about ‘saving the world’ and about the impact and importance of careers, but microbiologists really can save the world.  If you had any doubt about the importance of a career in microbiology, then just consider what is happening in the world now and what has happened since December.  …and we’re not just talking about personal and public health, but livelihoods and the global economy.  The economy has gone ‘pear-shaped’ because of a microbiological phenomenon, something that could be stopped by microbiologists, if they are, or were given the opportunity.  The power is in the hands of microbiologists and those with an intricate understanding of microbiology, to save the world, I have no doubt about that.  So, if you want a powerful career, an impactful career, a highly significant career, then consider microbiology!A FOOD MICROBIOLOGY CAREERHow about a career in food microbiology?  What might that look like and what might one be involved with?  Well even in food microbiology there are many varied areas to work in.  The three key areas are: i) food safety, ii) food spoilage/food quality and iii) fermented foods, probiotics and gut health.  Each of these has highly significant impacts on society and on the economy.  Let’s look at each of these in more detail.What is food safety?Food safety is all about ensuring the safety of the food supply.  This means monitoring, auditing, regulating and developing policy for the purposes of safeguarding raw materials and manufactured food over the entire agrifood supply chain from ‘farm to fork’ or ‘paddock to plate’ as the concept goes.  Food safety microbiologists closely associate with epidemiologists, public health professionals and infectious disease experts to combat prevention, tracking and limiting the spread of foodborne diseases of epidemic proportions.What is food spoilage and food quality?Spoilage and subsequent wastage of food results in substantial economic losses.  In countries with developing economies, such spoilage and waste of food is more likely to be fresh produce and thus postharvest and pre-manufacure losses.  In countries with advanced economies, the situation is quite different, with substantial spoilage and waste taking place at the consumer level.  Tight supply chains along with excellent mechanisms of food preservation mean that spoilage losses in such countries are at a minimum.What are fermented foods, probiotics and gut health?This area is closely linked with personal health and wellness.  There is a sustained food trend in the area of probiotics as functional foods, along with prebiotics and people realise the great benefits of how one’s gut health contributes to overall health and wellbeing.  Related to this are fermented foods, many of which are probiotic, and as such, are rich natural sources of ‘good’ bacteria.CAREER PROFILE OF A FOOD MICROBIOLOGISTWondering how a career in food microbiology might actually look like in reality?  Well, I had a Q & A session with Lucy Lam, a food safety auditor from Taipei, Taiwan.  Let’s find out what Lucy’s food microbiology career looks like…What qualification(s) do you hold and from where?Master of Science, with a major in food, nutrition and technology, from The Chinese University of Hong KongBachelor of Food Science, from The University of MelbourneYour present position and where?Auditor, Bureau Veritas Certification  (Taiwan)How would you describe your career ‘in a nutshell’?A passion for food safety and quality control along with being good at problem solving. 1.

Before and after the audit, preparation of the report document is needed.How do you gain most satisfaction in your food microbiology career?When I gained the most hands-on experience in food microbiology when I was working in the food industry between 2013 – 2018. As I was a laboratory supervisor and department assistant manager, I had to oversee the operation of the laboratory including lab supplies, SOPs, good laboratory practices and third party laboratory compliances.What can you forsee as big challenges in your particular area of food microbiology?Food microbiology testing can be regarded as a quality control gate for product release and assurance in food industry. Hence the testing lead time will be demanding and tends to be “quick and accurate”. It is believed that rapid test kits or rapid test methods will be upcoming trends in food microbiology testing.Some advice about a career in food microbiology?It is suggested people who wish to be a food microbiologist must have basic food knowledge, and willing to do a lot of research and study.So there you have it, whether it’s building the health of individuals through improving gut health, ensuring public health is maintained through a safe food supply or curbing the substantial economic losses through food spoilage and food waste, there are multiple ways to save the world as a food microbiologist!

Viruses,viruses,Gastro Coronavirus,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/gastro-coronavirus/,"April 5, 2020","SARS-CoV-2 is a novel Coronavirus that only became known in November or December 2019 in Wuhan, China.  It is currently decimating the world population in epic proportions and crippling the global economy.  The word “unprecedented” is frequently used to describe events associated with the impacts of this virus, because it is unlike anything that most of us have seen in our lifetimes, and unlikely to ever see again during our lifetime.Figure 1: Symptoms of COVID-19, in comparison with the common cold and flu.Many of us are very familiar with the symptoms regarded as typical of COVID-19 (Figure 1) – the dry cough and sore throat, fever and headaches, then if it progresses to the lungs, breathing difficulties.  As more and more studies are carried out of the many patients, we discover new information about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.  For example, a loss of the sense of taste and smell has been seen in some patients as one of the first symptoms.  Since early reports of the clinical presentation of this disease, gastrointestinal symptoms have been stated by patients, albeit in much less occurrence compared with the ‘classic’ COVID-19 symptoms stated above.  What does this mean?  Does the virus effect a gastrointestinal disturbance remotely from the respiratory tract?  or in some less frequent situations, has the virus been ingested with food or swallowed with saliva only AND been able to beat the harsh stomach conditions which normally are a formidable barrier to any would-be pathogen seeking to gain entry to the body through the gastrointestinal tract.  As a form of non-specific defence, hydrochloric acid in the stomach at a pH of 2.9 (Figure 2) is certainly sufficient to prevent passage of many pathogens.  However, not SARS-CoV-2 to an extent – but just we don’t know to what extent.  So, does this gastrointestinal involvement add further weight to the speculation of COVID-19 as a foodborne disease?  From a scientific perspective, where overwhelming evidence is required to move an idea from speculation to theory to ‘acceptance’, the ‘jury is still out’, so to speak.  Let’s look at what the scientific and medical literature tells us and what weight it adds to this theory of COVID-19 being a foodborne disease, in addition to its more traditional aerosol-mediated transmission.Figure 2: pH of the human stomach, in comparison with other animals.Firstly, Jinet al.(2020) noted that of 651 of the early patients in China between January 17 and February 8, 8.1% reported diarrhoea as their only symptom, while a much smaller proportion reported vomiting (1.7%) or nausea (1.5%) as their only symptom.  Guanet al.(2020) studied 1 099 of the early COVID-19 patients in Wuhan and found that 5.8% percent of patients with severe COVID-19 had diarrhoea (with other symptoms) while 6.9% has nausea or vomiting, again, with other symptoms.  Yes, these are low numbers compared with the 70.5% with reported coughing, but still, those low numbers outside of the respiratory system seem to suggest something else is happening apart from the classic clinical presentation.  Indeed, Gaoet al.(2020) states that the connection between the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems is not completely understood.  Further interesting results were reported by Anet al.(2020) who described nine patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but only presented with gastrointestinal symptoms.  Their gastrointestinal symptoms proceeded their hospital visit by a median of 2.1 days with none of these patients having fever at the onset.  Five of those patients went on to develop a fever and/or cough (although not necessarily a dry cough) within two to five days.  Interestingly, the remaining four patients developed neither respiratory symptoms nor fever.  While a clinical presentation of gastrointestinal symptoms only appears relatively rare, they may not be too uncommon in combination with the more classic COVID-19 symptoms.  Figure 1, from Holshueet al.(2020), presents a meaningful diagram of the symptoms experienced by the first positive case reported in the United States – nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort were all experienced by this patient during the course of the illness.  Furthermore, Luoet al.(2020) reported an even greater percentage of SARS-CoV-2-positive patients who presented with gastrointestinal symptoms only – a total of 16% from a sample size of 1 141, which were all the patients seen at one hospital in Wuhan between January 1 and February 20.  In this study, loss of appetite was the most commonly experienced gastrointestinal symptom.Figure 3: Clinical symptoms experienced by the first reported COVID-19 patient in the United States.All these studies, and others, raise the real possibility of a feacal-oral route of transmission, which in at least cases, indicates poor hygiene connected with foodborne transmission.  This is supported by the unpublished results quoted by Guet al.(2020) that two independent laboratories in China isolated infective SARS-CoV-2 viruses (virions) from human stool samples and the report that SARS-CoV-2 has been found in wastewater.  Lodder and de Roda Husman (2020) discovered the virus in wastewater at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, just four days after the first reported case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Netherlands.So, what have we got here – i) a range of gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by a small but certainly not insignificant proportion of SARS-CoV-2 patients, ii) an infectious particle that clearly is not necessarily inactivated by the acidic conditions of the stomach, iii) presence of the virus in stool samples and wastewater.  This all certainly adds more weight to a faecal-oral route route of transmission for SARS-CoV-2 and the likelihood of COVID-19 being a foodborne disease – don’t you think?ReferencesAn, P., Chen, H., Jiang, X., Su, J., Xiao, Y., Ding, Y., … & Lv, X.

Viruses,"bacteria, viruses",COVID-19 or Wuhan pneumonia?,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/covid-19-or-wuhan-pneumonia/,"March 29, 2020","This is a controversial topic, with potentially racial connotations, apparently, but are they justified?  Media and politicians have got into ‘hot water’ this year for their names/remarks/statements of association of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 with its country/city/culture/race of origin, an example of which is shown in Figure 1.  Are these comments appropriate/suitable or are they racially derogatory?  What I want to point out there are the origins of the names of some important viruses and the diseases they cause.  A bit of historical context which shows similarities and differences over the last 130 years or so.  This doesn’t necessarily make the current situation right or wrong, but I just wanted to put it into perspective with some historical context.  Yes, times change and what was acceptable in the past may not be acceptable today.  However, I did want to point out that the name “COVID-19” does seem inconsistent with historical naming of pandemic viruses and their diseases.  When we consider the names of foodborne bacterial pathogens, the current viral naming convention seems even more out of place.  However this is the 21st century and we are experiencing and unprecedented event, which may also apply to naming conventions.Figure 1: Donald Trump’s “famous” tweet on 17 March 2020.Let’s start with some biology – viruses, by their very nature, are different from everything else in the biological world.  They are considered in studies of biology, but it needs to be pointed out that viruses are not living organisms as they don’t satisfy the seven criteria of life (Figure 2).  Unless they infect a host cell, they are simply an inert package of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat.  As they are not living organisms, their nomenclature is also very different.  Taxonomists have attempted to place them in a hierarchal taxonomic scheme, but due to their fundamental differences with all living things, it isn’t the same.  Thus, their names tend to be rather informal, especially when compared to the strict naming conventions of living things; animals, plants, bacteria, fungi and others.Figure 2: Characteristics of living things.What prompted this blog post was a petition I signed late in January regarding what I (and tens of thousands of others) considered at the time to be a rather racist reference on the front page of theHerald Sun, a Melbourne newspaper (Figure 3).  However now, I wondering if it was really that bad.  Let’s explore.Figure 3: The front page of Melbourne’sHerald Sunnewspaper on 29 January 2020.The front page of theHerald Sunon that day referred to the nCoV-2019 (as it was still known at the time) as the “Chinese Virus”.  There was an uproar over this racially orientated headline and the newspaper forced to apologise.  However, when one looks back over the names of other viruses and the diseases they’ve caused, the name seemed quite fitting.  SARS-CoV-2 (as it is known now) originated in China and in Wuhan specifically.  Therefore, calling the virus the “Chinese Virus” and maybe calling the disease “Wuhan pneumonia” rather than COVID-19 is more meaningful.  This is especially when one considers other viral (influenza) pandemics last century and late in the 19th century.  The 1889-1890 influenza pandemic that originated in Bukhara, Uzbekistan (which then was a semi-independent state under Russian protection) is known as Russian flu; the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic is known as  Spanish flu (Figure 4) because the Spanish, not subject to wartime media censorship, reported more details of the sickness, death and suffering more than anywhere else in the world; the 1957-1958 influenza pandemic which originated in China’s Guizhou province is known as Asian flu (Figure 5); while the 1968 influenza pandemic which originated in Hong Kong is known as Hong Kong flu (Figure 6).  Furthermore, the H5N1 influenza outbreak of 2004 which originated in Thailand and Vietnam is commonly known as avian or bird flu, while the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 which originated in Mexico is known as swine flu… …and how about the last Coronavirus outbreak?  That started in 2012 and caused by MERS-CoV, with the disease called Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome.  This is the official name given to the disease by the WHO.  Why? …because the disease originated in the Middle East.  With all this in mind, we’re calling the disease of the current Coronavirus pandemic COVID-19?  That really seems out of place while Chinese or Wuhan pneumonia seems more appropriate.  Ok, so that’s some history of names of viral diseases and the viruses that cause them.  Let’s turn our attention to bacteria, especially foodborne disease pathogens.Figure 4: The 1918-1919 influenza pandemic was known as the Spanish flu.Figure 5: The 1957-1958 influenza pandemic was known as the Asian flu.Figure 6: The 1968 influenza pandemic was known as the Hong Kong flu.As a point of comparison, some of the biggest names in foodborne bacterial pathogens, some of which are zoonotic, areSalmonella, Escherichia(especiallyE. coli) andListeria, all of which are named after people, as wereShigellaandYersinia.  These bacteria were usually named after the scientists who discovered them.Escherichianamed after Theodor Escherich from Germany (Figure 7).Listerianamed after Joseph Lister from England.Salmonellanamed after Daniel Elmer Salmon from the United States (Figure 8).Shigellanamed after Kiyoshi Shiga from Japan.Yersinianamed after Alexandre Emile Jean Yersin from Switzerland.Figure 7: The name origin forEscherichiabacteria.Figure 8: The name origin forSalmonellabacteria.Especially with bacterial names, it is a great honour and privilege to have a bacterium named after you, yet China and Wuhan consider it a dishonour.  We call H1N1 swine flu and H5N1 bird flu – do we consider if this is a dishonour to pigs and birds?  So, from this we can see that microbial names and/or the diseases they cause have typically reflected some key and/or specific aspect of their origin, but COVID-19?  it really doesn’t seem to match, especially based on historical naming conventions, but is now considered racially derogatory (Figure 9) …unless the World Health Organization or others are breaking with tradition and starting a new nomenclature convention?Figure 9: Many viral pandemics have been named based on where they originated.This actually does seem to be the case, to some extent. The reader is referred to a comprehensive paper written by the Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on virus and specifically Coronavirus nomenclature and taxonomy (Gorbalenyaet al., 2020). It was published online inNature Microbiologyon 2 March 2020 The details presented highlight the highly scientific based approach to viral taxonomy, even though the names settled on for viruses may not always seem particularly scientific. In particular, I draw attention to this extract from their paper: “Apart from disease, geography and the organism from which a given virus was isolated also dominate the nomenclature, occasionally engraving connections that may be accidental (rather than typical) or even stigmatising, which should be avoided”.  There seems to be some errors in wording of this sentence, but you get the gist.  From this one can see that scientists are working hard to bring formal naming rules into practice (that fit into taxonomic hierarchy) which accurately reflect the disease and entity causing disease, while ensuring the names avoid stigmatising cultures, groups or countries.  So yes, times change, people change, everything changes.  These improved naming conventions have changed the way pandemics and their viruses are named.  Therefore, COVID-19 is an accurate way to scientifically represent this disease by name, rather than “Wuhan pneumonia”, which is not appropriate in many ways, not even in casual/informal conversation.ReferenceGorbalenya, A.E., Baker, S.C., Baric, R.S.et al.The speciesSevere acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus: classifying 2019-nCoV and naming it SARS-CoV-2.Nat Microbiol5,536–544 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41564-020-0695-z","bacteriology, clinical microbiology, food microbiology, medical microbiology, microbiology, nomenclature, taxonomy, virology"
Viruses,viruses,COVID-19: A likely foodborne disease.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/covid-19-a-likely-foodborne-disease/,"March 15, 2020","Can SARS-CoV-2 be transmitted by food?  Is COVID-19 a food borne disease?  These are questions on many people’s lips … no pun intended.  What makes a foodborne disease a foodborne disease?  How is personal hygiene, or the lack thereof related to foodborne disease?  Is it personal hygiene, cleanliness or just a cultural practice that happens to result in a “foodborne disease”?  Is it really a foodborne disease if an infectious agent is transferred to a food’s surface, then shortly thereafter ingested?  There are many grey areas I feel in this regard, many uncertainties and much knowledge to be uncovered.Figure 1: A scope of foodborne disease.At this stage, a definition of foodborne disease is useful.  The World Health Organization (WHO) says that foodborne disease is “the result of ingestion of foodstuffs contaminated with microorganisms or chemicals”.  Seems a simple definition, but is it broad enough? or too broad? (Figure 1)  Food products contaminated on the farm or in the factory are clear candidates for foodborne disease, as are dishes in the food service environment or at home that are contaminated.  …but what about dishes that are contaminated on the table at the time of consumption? this surely could be regarded as transit contamination, but certainly they are contaminated.  Does contamination of a food product for five seconds, five hours or five days before consumption matter?  Does it still fit the WHO’s foodborne disease definition?  It would seem too.  If that’s the case, then the advice given by authorities in China would seem to be related to curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by foodborne means.  Followthis linkto read the news story I’m talking about, where the age-old practice of communal eating from a bowl or plate of food in the centre of the table is entrenched in Chinese culture (Figure 2).Figure 2: How the Chinese eat.If you’ve ever eaten with a bunch of Chinese people, and not dipping your chopsticks in with the rest of them and helping yourself to find, then you’ll know how left out you can be.  So the situation is this – authorities in China are trying to change these food serving practices that are ingrained in the very culture of being Chinese, by asking people to use serving utensils to serve from a common bowl or plate, rather than using their own utensils.  It’s commonplace and widely practiced in western culture, but just not something that has received acceptance in the east.  It has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 may be transmitted from the saliva of one person, to their chopsticks, then onto food/soup or the communal dish, before transfer to the chopsticks of someone else and into their mouth for ingestion.  This has been one postulated explanation as to why many family clusters of COVID-19 are seen.  Of course there is inhalation of airborne virus-laden droplets (Figure 3) and pickup of visions from inanimate surfaces, but food as a vehicle of transmission, as transit as it is, has been suggested as being a contributor.Figure 3: Airborne droplets from a sneeze.Not only in China, but with COVID-19 starting to really take off in the United States, there is some food-related advice to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.  For example, theLos Angeles Times reportsthat Costco has stopped in-store food samples and some buffet restaurants in Las Vegas casinos are not operating (Figure 4).  Then, what’s to say that shed virus from an asymptomatically SARS-CoV-2 infected person can’t breath or caught on to a ready-to-eat (RTE) food product, like a sandwich or salad, which can then serve as the vehicle of transmission.  There seem to be no studies on survival of SARS-CoV-2 on the surface of food, but with the surfaces this virus can survive on, and the duration it can survive, a transient passage on a food surface between human hosts seems plausible.  Despite no scientific basis as yet, the action to suspend questionable food serving practices is certainly suggestive of a distinct possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted through food, even transient transmission, such as is likely to occur in communal bowls/plates during meals in the east.Figure 4: Buffet restaurants close in Las Vegas due to COVID-19The question then is, how much evidence is necessary before COVID-19 is declared a foodborne disease?  By right, full and proper robust epidemiological investigations need to be conducted with rigour, then shared in the peer-review literature.  However, we don’t have that luxury while a pandemic is underway.  Is it enough, based on likely logic, to say that foodborne transmission is plausible, but yet to be demonstrated and as such, COVID-19 needs to be regarded as a foodborne disease until demonstrated otherwise.  Under the current circumstances, is such an unprecedented step acceptable?  For the sake of public health, I would say yes.  The situation with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 is rapidly changing, with each day bringing another piece to the puzzle from different parts of the world.  Therefore, advice that seems logical and/or scientifically sound today, could be refuted tomorrow.  That’s the nature of science and scientific debates.My recommendation: Avoid circumstances where people could have transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to food, which is then consumed without further cooking/processing/treatment.  Thus, until demonstrated otherwise, consider COVID-19 to be a foodborne disease.","coronavirus, covid-19, food microbiology, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease, microbiology, sars-cov-2, virology"

However, hysteria aside, we need to put it into perspective.  As of today, there are 76 819 reported cases and 2 250 deaths – certainly serious by any measure.  This of course may be under reported and needs to be taken as a guide only.  Interestingly, this current global figure is similar to what the actual number of cases in Wuhan alone was predicted to be as at January 25, from the work of Wuet al.(2020), researchers from the The University of Hong Kong.  Therefore, from the “official” figures,  the crude calculation of case fatality rate (CFR) of this disease, which is currently at 2.5% needs to be taken very much as a guide only and treated with a great deal of caution.  While the total number of reported cases is clearly substantially greater than SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012 (Figure 1), it offers some (and I stress,some) guidance.  Whatever the situation turns out to be, the CFR rate is on the low side when compared with SARS and MERS (Figure 2), with younger healthy people rarely succumbing to the disease, meaning those that are in their senior years or immunocomprised in some way represent those that typically die from the COVID-19 disease.Figure 1: Comparison of the number of reported cases and reported deaths of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS and MERS.Figure 2: Case Fatality Rates (CFRs) of SARS in 2002/2003, MERS in 2012 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019/2020.An important epidemiological concept to consider is theBasic Reproduction Number, known as “R0”.  This number describes how quickly an infectious agent spreads, and is basically related to how many people one infected individual can infect.  An excellent article about this concept can be found here > (https://www.vox.com/2020/2/18/21142009/coronavirus-covid19-china-wuhan-deaths-pandemic).  The R0 of SARS-CoV-2 is on the low side of the scale (although two to three fold higher than seasonal Influenza) (Figure 3) and if you do acquire the virus, chances of a complete recovery are extremely high.  This is especially so if you are in the 10-39 age group, where the CFR is just 0.2% (Figure 4, which shows data from mainland China – data outside of mainland China show even lower CFRs).  In practical terms, this means that if you are aged between 10 and 39, and contract the virus, you have a 99.8% chance of making a full recovery.  Yet there is great fear amongst people, people taking all kinds of extreme measures to avoid being near people they consider represent ‘typical’ cases of the disease, even in countries like Australia and the US.  This irrational behaviour is certainly not justified, especially when one considers other diseases, with high CFRs.  Thus, social isolation of particular cultural groups and types of businesses operated by these people are of great concern and impact to (initially) the local economy, but later on, regional and maybe the global economy.Figure 3: Basic Reproduction Number (R0) of various key human infective viruses.Figure 4: Indicative CFR from COVID-19 reported cases in mainland China.Anyway, as I saying, there are other diseases with much higher CFRs -take listeriosis for example.  The CFR for listeriosis tends to hover around 20% overall (Figure 5), and is especially of concern for pregnant women who, if infected in the second or third trimester, are likely to survive, but their fetus will have a mortality rate of around 45%.  While this disease is relatively rare, with only 65 cases reported in Australia per year, its high mortality rate warrants extra care regarding exercising preventative measures.  Of even greater concern would be infection withVibrio vulnificus, the CFR of which is typically between 35 and 50% overall (Hlady & Klontz, 1996; Leeet al., 2013), usually due to consumption of raw oysters (Figure 6).  Despite this scary statistic, raw oyster consumption (which is the main vehicle of transmission of these bacteria from their natural marine habitat to humans) has remained popular over the years as evidenced by the reported outbreaks (CDC, 1993; CDC, 1996).  In fact, people seem to be so keen to consume raw oysters that they stick to belief in various myths they believe can protect them from infection, such as hot sauce and/or lemon juice having a killing effect on the bacteria – this is so not true!  In fact, it is laughable, a very humorous myth indeed.Figure 5: Comparison of the outcome of infection with key foodborne pathogens.Figure 6: Another death from eating raw oysters, due toVibrio vulnificusinfection.So, am I suggesting or advocating to take a casual stance with regard to SARS-CoV-2?  Far from it – what I’m actually saying is put everything into perspective.  There are times when one needs to exercise extreme caution, even when it may not seem warranted and times when one can be rather casual.  For example, we must think broadly and not only about ourselves.  Someone may be young and strong with a top performing immune system, but if their circumstances/actions might put others who are vulnerable, potentially in a bad position health-wise, then we must take more precautions than we consider necessary for ourselves.  Take for example, the recent spike of COVID-19 cases in South Korea.  Tens of cases are linked to one person, who refused to be tested for SARS-CoV-2, and has infected many people.  Even if she was in a low risk demographic (which she wasn’t be the way, being of age 61), she needs to consider that if she is infected, might it be of public health concern? might she infect other people?  This is what I mean by putting it all into perspective, considering it on a case-by-case basis and acting accordingly to prevent the spread of the infectious agent and thus doing a favour for your fellow human beings.  This is what needs to be paramount in one’s mind amidst a global pandemic, which according to epidemiological projections, won’t peak until April (Wuet al., 2020).The point to be made here is that there is almost hysteria surrounding infection with SARS-CoV-2, but many people are rather blaise about other infections that are actually severe, with a high death rate – such asListeria monocytogenesandVibrio vulnificusdiscussed above.  Please think logically and clearly when making choices and taking actions regarding infectious disease, disease prevention and public health implications –one poor choice can start a global pandemic,that’s all it takes.ReferencesCDC/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Viruses,"bacteria, food-safety, public-health, viruses",Zoonoses and foodborne disease,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/zoonoses-and-foodborne-disease/,"February 11, 2020","The current 2019-nCoV (example image in Figure 1) global pandemic has highlighted the importance of; animal reservoirs (and intermediate animal hosts) of disease, animal origins of human disease and zoonotic diseases and raises (again) the possibility of potential foodborne Coronavirus transmission.  This disease has been postulated to have crossed, probably in late November 2019, from animals to humans at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (Figure 2) in Wuhan, China.  I say postulated, because there are more links between this market and early reported cases of the disease, than not.  In fact, 55% of all cases reported in 2019 (n = 425) had contact with the market (Liet al., 2020).  However, interestingly, the first reported case had no contact with this market.  Thus, an element of doubt exists regarding the degree of involvement of this market.  Anyway, this  huge ‘wet’ market comprises over 1 000 stalls and is a substantial trading area for a multitude of different species of animals, both live and dead.  Most of the trade is for food purposes, i.e. human consumption, but some are for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), where certain body parts of sometimes rare species are used for therapeutic purposes.Figure 1: What Coronaviruses look like.Figure 2: Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China.While the presence of this, or indeed other, viruses in animals sold as food doesn’t constitute a foodborne disease as such, in theory they could very well be a foodborne disease, in addition to their recognition as a zoonoses.  However, the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (2015) has stated that no direct evidence exists for foodborne transmission of the SARS Coronavirus or the H5N1 Influenza virus and that direct contact with animals is the likely means of transfer of these viruses from animals to humans.  Presumably this could be the situation with 2019-nCoV too?  However, Rodriguez-Morales (2020) states “the possibility of foodborne transmission from animal derived matter which has recently been highlighted to influence the current epidemic”.  Certainly, the potential for foodborne transmission is there but they would probably get stopped in their tracks, so to speak, during cooking, since viruses tend to be rather heat sensitive.Figure 3: Some bacterial zoonotic diseases.All this got me thinking and investigating online about zoonoses in general, and I was reminded that many, many diseases are in fact zoonotic (Figure 3).  I forgot that HIV/AIDS was (is?) a zoonoses that originated in a non-human source.  Many other common diseases, including recognised foodborne disease are zoonotic as well.  In fact, typically the two most common foodborne diseases in many parts of the world, infection fromCampylobacterand fromSalmonella, are considered zoonotic infections.  These of course, primarily originate from poultry flocks, with occurrence so widespread that it is safer to regard or poultry and poultry products (for example eggs) as contaminated, than non-contaminated.  Fortunately from the perspective of public health, these bacteria have low heat resistance and are easily eliminated by standard cooking procedures.  By and large, the same could be said for viruses present in animals as food sources.  However, while the temperature for viral inactivation might be similar to bacteria, they rate of inactivation is seen to be slower.  Therefore, a pasteurisation process may not be effective in eliminating viruses like it is for elimination of bacteria.Figure 4: Scene at a wet market in Wuhan, China.  Credit to the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong for this image.Figure 5: Guangzhou, China in 2013. The original caption on flickr reads “To the left are the still alive rabbits, in the middle are the skins from the already sold ones-skin for sale as well at that stage, and to the right are two halves of fresh killed rabbit for sale. All for only 17 RMB per kilo. Source: https://www.flickr.com/photos/cookiesound/9637285106Another aspect to consider is the complexities of managing the microbial or disease-free status of animals that are sold as food.  In western countries, where the palate might be regarded as simpler, a rather limited number of animal species are reared for food purposes.  The vast majority of animal meat consumed probably comes from a limited number of species, most of which are farmed (rather than wild caught) under tightly controlled and regulated agriculture or aquaculture environments.  This enables the farmer and government regulators to closely monitor disease status and in turn, act swiftly if something is amiss with regard to the health status of the animals which might post a threat to human health.  With such controls, regulation and monitoring in place, foodborne disease outbreaks still occur that can be traced back to primary production.  Imagine then, in a market where a myriad of animal species are sold – some alive and some dead, some wild-caught and some from small-scale family farms (Figures 4 and 5).  With less knowledge and less understanding of the disease status of the animals, the presence of asymptomatic infections and how to manage any risks, one would think this situation poses an almost insurmountable task with regard to personal safety, food safety and indeed public health.  For example, we just really don’t know what is going on with wild animal reservoirs of human disease (Figure 6) and indeed, the animal origins of human disease.  As we are not (and from a practical perspective, cannot do so) monitoring wild animal populations for their disease status, or asymptomatic infection status, we just don’t know what viruses, bacteria or protozoan parasites they are harbouring and how they are mutating and if and when they might cross the species barrier to other animal species or humans.Figure 6: Some animal reservoirs of some human diseases.It seems there are many sources of the problem, with Liet al.(2020) raising another when they state that positive attitudes towards the consumption of wild-caught game meat is at the root of the problem.  Regardless, I feel that this 2019-nCoV situation reminds us to be vigilant – there is much we don’t know about virulence and pathogenesis of infectious diseases and even when we have controls, monitoring and regulations in place, anything can still go amiss, simply because we’re dealing with an unpredictable dynamic biological system.  Therefore, as a global community let’s work together, let’s contribute together, let’s share together!ReferencesAdvisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food Adhoc Group on Foodborne Viral Infections.

Yeast,"bacteria, food-quality, fungi, yeast",From HPP Innovation Week – Part 2,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/from-hpp-innovation-week-part-2/,"July 5, 2024","This is the second of a two-part series of overview blog articles written byChloe Lam(chloe.lam@foodmicrobiology.academy), who attended the HPP Innovation Week session from 18-20 June 2024.Food safety controlRegarding risk analysis for ensuring food safety in food production, HPP has a role in controlling biological hazards (i.e. pathogens). By modifying HPP parameters including pressure, holding time, and water temperature, HPP can be integrated into HACCP plans as the critical control point. According to @Mario González, Ph.d. | HPP Applications Manager at Hiperbaric, HPP even has the potential to reduce the allergenicity of certain foods and reduce the concentration of mycotoxin.HPP can be used to facilitate hazard control in food products. It can be used in controlling the pathogenic microbial concentration. In terms of bacterial inactivation, HPP helps meeting the performance criterion of > 3log reduction of bacteria level established by the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference. The limitation of spoilage microorganisms can minimize the formation of TMA, which lowers the risk of food poisoning. Besides, the HPP technique can facilitate the elimination of parasites. Mild HPP conditions for around 180 seconds can completely inactivate parasites from raw fish fillets. The use of mild HPP conditions not only can eliminate parasites, but also minimize the impact on quality.HPP is a versatile nonthermal food preservation technique that inactive pathogens while maintaining sensory and nutritional qualities. The implementation of HPP allows for avoiding product recalls and market withdrawals associated with biological hazards.Application in various productsMultiple researches have been conducted on various food products, including craft beer, cold brew coffee, durian, and seafood. All showed an extended reduction of spoilage bacteria levels after HPP. Unlike thermal pasteurization, HPP maintains the stability of products and does not change the quality profile of food.Taking craft beer as an illustrative example, HPP has a growing market in this field, driven by the increasing popularity and demand.  This technology can extend the shelf-life of products without the need for heating or the addition of preservatives. Even though pasteurization can effectively prevent microbial growth, it would also induce unfavorable alterations such as accelerated aging and developing a stale flavor. Notably, a significant reduction of spoilage bacteria (3.1log) is maintained throughout the product’s shelf-life (@Rui Queirós, Ph.d. | HPP Applications Specialist at Hiperbaric).On the flip side, HPP also proves highly advantageous in preserving the quality of craft beer. It can retain the quality of craft beer without altering sensory attributes, color, and alcohol content. Customers are unable to distinguish HPP-treated beer from untreated samples in sensory tests, indicating the process preserves the intended flavor profile. This highlights HPP’s suitability for maintaining the authentic taste and sensory characteristics of products, avoiding the quality degradation that can occur with heat-based treatments.Overall, the versatility of HPP technology is illustrated where it can extend shelf-life and preserve the inherent sensory qualities that consumers demand, without compromising the integrity of the final product.SummaryHigh Pressure Processing (HPP) is an innovative nonthermal food preservation technology that is transforming the food industry. By using high hydrostatic pressure, HPP can inactivate harmful microorganisms and extend the shelf-life of a wide range of food products, from meat and seafood to beverages and dips, while preserving their natural flavors, nutrients, and appearance. Compared to traditional thermal pasteurisation, HPP offers significant advantages, including the ability to create “clean label” foods with minimal additives, improve visual appeal, and facilitate more efficient and higher-yielding extraction of shellfish meat. With a rapidly growing global market, HPP is well-positioned to address consumer demand for minimally processed, safe, and high-quality foods.","food industry, food manufacturing, food microbiology, food preservation, food processing, Food safety, food science, foodborne disease"
Yeast,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, fungi, yeast",Good health from fermented dairy products,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/good-health-from-fermented-dairy-products/,"July 1, 2023","This month we’ve featured fermented goods in a big way – this is the third and final post to showcase the diversity of fermented foods across the world.  This article is about dairy products, where we feature a couple of examples in detail.  To start with, here are some unusual and different fermented dairy products from around the world:Skyr: A traditional Icelandic dairy product that resembles yogurt but has a thicker, creamier consistency. It is made from skim milk and is high in protein.Filmjölk: A fermented milk product from Sweden, similar to yogurt but with a thinner consistency. It has a slightly sour taste and is often enjoyed with fruits or muesli.Kefir: A fermented milk drink that originated in the Caucasus region. It is made by fermenting milk with kefir grains, which are a combination of bacteria and yeast. Kefir has a tangy taste and a slightly effervescent texture.Kumis: A traditional fermented dairy product from Central Asia, particularly popular in Mongolia. It is made from fermented mare’s milk and has a slightly sour and fizzy taste.Tarhana: A dried fermented dairy product found in various forms across the Middle East, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe. It is made from a mixture of fermented milk, wheat flour, and vegetables, and is often used to make soups.Dadih: A traditional Indonesian fermented buffalo milk product. It is made by coagulating the milk with a local wild grass called “elephantopus,” resulting in a custard-like texture and a tangy flavor.Clabber: A traditional Southern United States dairy product made by allowing raw milk to naturally ferment and sour. It has a thick consistency and is often used as a base for cooking or eaten with sweeteners.Suutei Tsai: A Mongolian traditional tea made with fermented milk. It is prepared by boiling green tea with milk and allowing it to ferment, resulting in a unique and tangy beverage.Amasi: A fermented milk product from Southern Africa, also known as maas. It is similar to yogurt but has a thicker consistency and a slightly sour taste.Chal: A fermented dairy product from Iran, particularly in the Gilan and Mazandaran provinces. It is made by fermenting raw cow’s milk and has a thick texture and tangy flavor.Photo by Pixabay onPexels.comSuutei Tsai,also known as Suutei Tsai, is a traditional Mongolian tea made with milk and served as a popular beverage in Mongolia. It is prepared by boiling green tea with milk, resulting in a unique and distinct flavor.The name “Suutei Tsai” translates to “milk tea” in Mongolian, reflecting its main ingredients and preparation method. The tea is typically made using a specific type of green tea leaves called “brick tea,” which are pressed into compact blocks and stored for aging before use.To make Suutei Tsai, the brick tea leaves are first broken into smaller pieces and then boiled in water. The tea is simmered for an extended period to extract the flavors from the leaves fully. During this process, the tea develops a robust and slightly bitter taste.After the tea is brewed, milk is added to create a creamy and rich texture. The amount of milk used can vary based on personal preference and regional variations. Some recipes call for equal parts tea and milk, while others use a higher ratio of milk to tea.Suutei Tsai is often sweetened with salt or sometimes with sugar or butter, depending on personal preference. The addition of salt is a unique characteristic of Mongolian milk tea, giving it a slightly savory taste that distinguishes it from other milk teas found in different cultures.This tea holds significant cultural importance in Mongolia and is commonly consumed throughout the day, particularly during meals or social gatherings. It serves as a warming and comforting beverage in the cold climate of Mongolia and is believed to have various health benefits, including aiding digestion and providing energy.Suutei Tsai represents the fusion of Mongolian nomadic traditions and the influence of neighboring cultures. It has become an integral part of Mongolian cuisine and cultural identity, offering a distinct and delightful tea-drinking experience.Clabber is a traditional dairy product that has been consumed for centuries, particularly in rural and farming communities. It is a type of milk that has naturally soured and thickened due to the activity of lactic acid bacteria. Clabber is often associated with Southern United States cuisine, where it has been a staple for generations.The process of making clabber is relatively simple. Fresh raw milk is left at room temperature for an extended period, typically overnight or up to 24 hours. During this time, naturally occurring bacteria in the milk convert lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid through the process of fermentation. This fermentation results in the milk thickening and developing a tangy, slightly sour taste.The texture and consistency of clabber can vary, depending on factors such as the temperature and the specific bacteria present. It can range from a slightly thickened milk to a custard-like consistency. The flavor is typically tart and tangy, similar to yogurt or buttermilk.Clabber can be consumed as is or used as an ingredient in various dishes. It is often enjoyed as a stand-alone food or served with sweeteners such as honey or sugar. It can also be used as a base for cooking, where it adds a tangy flavor to recipes like pancakes, biscuits, or cornbread.It’s worth noting that the production of clabber involves raw milk, which may contain harmful bacteria. Therefore, it’s important to ensure the milk comes from a safe and trusted source. In modern times, pasteurized milk is often used to make clabber as a safer alternative.Clabber represents a traditional and simple form of dairy fermentation, preserving milk while providing a tangy and distinctive flavor. It showcases the natural transformative power of bacteria and demonstrates how simple culinary techniques can create unique and culturally significant foods.Photo by Matthias Zomer onPexels.com","fermentation, food microbiology, food science, healthy eating, microbiology, probiotics"
Yeast,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, food-quality, fungi, viruses, yeast",50 facts about food microbiology!,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/50-facts-about-food-microbiology/,"June 26, 2023","Food microbiology is the study of microorganisms that interact with food, including bacteria, viruses, yeasts, molds, and parasites.Microorganisms can be both beneficial and harmful to food. Beneficial microorganisms are used in processes like fermentation and production of certain foods, while harmful microorganisms can cause foodborne illnesses.Bacteria are the most common microorganisms associated with food spoilage and foodborne diseases.Some common bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses includeSalmonella,Escherichiacoli(E. coli),Listeriamonocytogenes, andCampylobacter.Viruses, such as Norovirus and Hepatitis A, can also contaminate food and cause foodborne illnesses.Yeasts and molds are responsible for food spoilage and can affect the texture, flavor, and appearance of food.Microorganisms can contaminate food at various stages, including during production, processing, transportation, and storage.Foodborne illnesses can result from consuming contaminated raw or undercooked food, improper food handling and preparation, cross-contamination, and inadequate storage temperatures.Temperature control is crucial in preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms. The temperature danger zone for food is between 4 °C (40 °F) and 60 °C (140°F).Pasteurisation is a process that involves heating food to a specific temperature to kill or inactivate harmful microorganisms, while retaining the food’s quality.Fermentation is a process that uses beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and yeasts, to convert sugars into alcohol or acids. Examples include yogurt, cheese, sauerkraut, and pickles.Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when consumed in adequate amounts, provide health benefits. They are often found in fermented foods and are known to promote gut health.Food preservation techniques, such as canning, drying, and freezing, aim to prevent or slow down the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.Good hygiene practices, including proper handwashing, cleaning and sanitizing of surfaces, and maintaining personal hygiene, are essential in preventing the spread of microorganisms in food.Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) is a systematic approach used in the food industry to identify and control potential hazards related to food safety.Foodborne illnesses can have various symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and in severe cases, organ failure or death.Proper cooking temperatures are critical to ensure the elimination of harmful microorganisms. For example, poultry should reach an internal temperature of 74 °C (165 °F), while ground meat should reach 71 °C (160 °F).Cross-contamination can occur when raw foods come into contact with cooked or ready-to-eat foods, potentially transferring harmful microorganisms. Separate cutting boards and utensils should be used for raw and ready-to-eat foods.Some food products undergo a process called aseptic packaging, which involves sterilizing the food and packaging materials separately and then filling the sterile food into sterile containers.The pH level of a food product can influence the growth of microorganisms. Most bacteria prefer a neutral pH around 7, while some acid-tolerant bacteria can grow in low-pH environments.Food poisoning is a type of foodborne illness caused by the ingestion of toxins produced by certain bacteria, such asStaphylococcusaureusandBacilluscereus.Food intoxication occurs when the ingestion of food contaminated with live microorganisms leads to illness. Examples includeSalmonellaandCampylobacterinfections.Food allergies are immune responses triggered by specific proteins in food. They are not caused by microorganisms but can be influenced by cross-contamination or improper labeling.Botulism is a severe form of food poisoning caused by the toxin produced by the bacteriumClostridiumbotulinum. It can result from improperly canned or preserved foods.Fermented dairy products, such as yogurt and kefir, contain beneficial bacteria known as probiotics, which can contribute to a healthy gut microbiome.The use of antibiotics in livestock can contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can potentially be transmitted to humans through contaminated food.The development of rapid diagnostic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing, has revolutionised the detection and identification of microorganisms in food.Food microbiologists often work closely with food scientists, food safety experts, and regulatory agencies to ensure the safety and quality of food products.Food recalls can occur when a product is found to be contaminated with harmful microorganisms or other hazards. They are initiated to protect public health.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, are used in the production of alcoholic beverages through the process of fermentation.Foodborne pathogens can survive and multiply in refrigerated environments, emphasising the importance of proper storage temperatures and practices.Cross-protective adaptations can occur between different microorganisms in food, where the presence of one microorganism inhibits the growth of another.Food fermentation can enhance the nutritional value of foods by increasing the availability of certain vitamins and minerals.Some moulds produce mycotoxins, which are toxic compounds that can contaminate food. Examples include aflatoxins, produced byAspergillusmolds, which can be found in nuts, grains, and spices.Biopreservation is a technique that uses naturally occurring microorganisms or their products to inhibit the growth of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in food.The microbial composition of food can vary depending on factors such as the source of the food, processing methods, and storage conditions.Some beneficial bacteria, such as those in the genusLactobacillusandBifidobacterium, are commonly used as starter cultures in the production of fermented dairy products.Foodborne illness outbreaks can occur when multiple people experience similar symptoms after consuming contaminated food from a common source.Food safety regulations and guidelines differ among countries and are often based on risk assessments and scientific evidence.The use of bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) is being explored as a potential alternative to antibiotics for controlling bacterial pathogens in food.Some microorganisms, such as those in the genusSaccharomyces, are used in bread making and contribute to the fermentation process, resulting in the production of carbon dioxide and alcohol.High-pressure processing (HPP) is a non-thermal food preservation technique that uses high pressure to inactivate microorganisms while retaining the nutritional value and quality of food.Microorganisms can form biofilms on food contact surfaces, making them more resistant to cleaning and sanitising agents.The presence of certain microorganisms, such asPseudomonasspp., can accelerate the spoilage of fresh produce.Foodborne illnesses can have significant economic impacts, including medical costs, loss of productivity, and damage to the reputation of food manufacturers.The study of foodborne pathogens and their transmission routes is essential for developing effective control strategies to prevent foodborne illnesses.Some microorganisms, such as certain strains of bacteria and yeasts, can produce enzymes that enhance the flavor and texture of food products.Food safety training and education are vital for food handlers and consumers to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure proper food handling practices.Microbial testing is commonly used in the food industry to monitor the quality and safety of food products.Ongoing research in food microbiology aims to develop novel methods for microbial control, improve food preservation techniques, and enhance our understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and food.","food microbiologist, food microbiology, food preservation, Food safety, food science, food spoilage, foodborne disease, microbiology"
Yeast,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, fungi, yeast",Fermented vegetables for health,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/fermented-vegetables-for-health/,"June 21, 2023","Tsukemonois a traditional Japanese term that refers to a variety of pickled vegetables. It is a popular side dish and condiment in Japanese cuisine, often served alongside meals to provide a balance of flavors and textures. Tsukemono can range from simple salted pickles to more complex, seasoned and fermented varieties.The process of making tsukemono typically involves preserving vegetables in a brine or salt to extract moisture and promote fermentation. This fermentation process can vary in duration, from a few hours to several months, depending on the desired flavor and texture. The brine or salt mixture may also contain additional seasonings like rice bran, vinegar, soy sauce, miso, or spices to impart different flavors.There are numerous types of tsukemono, each with its unique taste and characteristics. Some common examples include:Shibazuke: A popular tsukemono from Kyoto, made with cucumbers, eggplant, ginger, and perilla leaves, fermented in a sweet and sour purple-red brine.Takuan: Yellow pickled daikon radish, often sliced and served as a crunchy and slightly sweet accompaniment to rice or sushi.Umeboshi: Pickled Japanese plums that are salty, tangy, and sour in taste. They are commonly enjoyed as a condiment or added to rice balls (onigiri).Gari: Sweet and tangy pickled ginger often served with sushi to cleanse the palate between bites.Asazuke: Quick-pickled vegetables that are lightly salted and usually left to marinate for a short time, resulting in a crunchy texture and a refreshing flavor.Fukujinzuke: A mixed vegetable pickle typically used as a condiment for Japanese curry. It consists of various vegetables like daikon, lotus root, and cucumber, pickled in a soy-based sauce.Tsukemono can vary in taste, texture, and appearance depending on the region, ingredients, and preparation methods. They add a vibrant and refreshing element to Japanese meals, providing a balance of flavors to complement the main dishes.Escabecheis a traditional dish and cooking technique that has roots in Spanish cuisine but is also prevalent in Latin American, Filipino, and Mediterranean cuisines. The term “escabeche” refers to a method of preserving and flavoring food by marinating it in a vinegar-based sauce or marinade.In its most common form, escabeche typically involves fish or meat that is first cooked, then immersed in a marinade composed of vinegar, oil, onions, garlic, and various herbs and spices. The dish is then left to marinate for a period of time, allowing the flavors to meld together and the protein to absorb the tangy and aromatic characteristics of the marinade.The marinade used in escabeche can vary depending on the regional and cultural influences. Some common ingredients used in the marinade include:Vinegar: The primary acidic component of escabeche, vinegar provides the distinctive tangy flavor and acts as a preservative.Oil: Usually olive oil or vegetable oil, which adds richness and helps balance the acidity of the vinegar.Onions: Thinly sliced onions are often a key component of the marinade, imparting a sweet and savory flavor.Garlic: Crushed or minced garlic cloves are frequently added to enhance the overall flavor profile.Herbs and Spices: Bay leaves, oregano, thyme, peppercorns, and chili peppers are commonly used to season the marinade and add aromatic and spicy notes.The marinated protein, whether fish or meat, is typically served cold or at room temperature. The marinade not only imparts flavor but also acts as a preservative, allowing the dish to be enjoyed over an extended period. It is common to find escabeche served as an appetizer, a side dish, or even as a main course, accompanied by rice, bread, or other side dishes.Escabeche can be versatile, with variations in different regions and cultures. For example, in the Philippines, it is often made with fried fish and served as a popular dish called “escabeche de pescado.”Overall, escabeche offers a unique blend of flavors, combining the acidity of the vinegar, the richness of the oil, and the aromatic herbs and spices. It provides a tangy and savory addition to the culinary landscape.Pickled watermelon rindis a unique and flavorful food product made from the rind or peel of watermelon, which is typically discarded. Instead of being wasted, the rind is preserved and transformed into a tangy and sweet pickled delicacy.The process of making pickled watermelon rind involves removing the green outer skin and any remaining pink flesh from the watermelon rind. The rind is then typically cut into bite-sized pieces or strips, although shapes can vary depending on personal preference and regional traditions.The rind is then soaked in a brine solution containing vinegar, sugar, and various spices and seasonings. The brine helps to impart flavor, preserve the rind, and balance the natural sweetness with acidity. Commonly used spices and seasonings include cinnamon, cloves, ginger, allspice, and sometimes chili peppers for a touch of heat.After soaking in the brine for a period of time, which can range from a few days to several weeks, the watermelon rind absorbs the flavors and undergoes a transformation. The result is a pickled watermelon rind with a firm yet tender texture and a sweet and tangy taste profile. The rind retains some of its natural sweetness while being infused with the flavors of the brine and spices.Pickled watermelon rind is often enjoyed as a snack or side dish. It can be eaten on its own or paired with other foods like cheese or cured meats. In some regions, it is also used as a condiment or relish, adding a unique touch to sandwiches or salads.The pickling process not only enhances the flavor and texture of the watermelon rind but also helps to extend its shelf life, allowing it to be enjoyed for an extended period. It is a delightful example of utilizing a typically discarded part of the watermelon and transforming it into a delicious and versatile culinary treat.","fermentation, food microbiology, food preservation, food science, foods of the world"
Yeast,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, food-safety, fungi, viruses, yeast",The Food Safety Modernization Act: Transforming Food Safety Practices in the USA,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/the-food-safety-modernization-act-transforming-food-safety-practices-in-the-usa/,"June 7, 2023","Today, 7 June 2023, is World Food Safety Day, a day the World Health Organisation has set aside to focus on failings in food safety and to celebrate achievements in food safety.  This year’s theme is about how food standards in food safety save lives.  There’s no doubt that they do.  When one looks back to the 19th century, even, or maybe especially, in the the great industrialised nations of the modern world, up and coming food manufacturers, either out of ignorance or deliberately, manufactured foods that were certainly not in the public’s best interests.  While we don’t have the level of morbidity and mortality we once did, there’s no doubt that foodborne disease represents a totally unacceptable high amount of illness, death and economic burden in our communities.  What makes it even more difficult to understand is that foodborne illness is largely preventable, through the following of procedures, processes and protocols that have been developed following rigorous basic scientific research.  Thus, food standards at all levels (local, state, federal), play an absolutely critical role in safeguarding the food supply of a nation.In this article, we want to focus on the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), a turning point in food safety in the United States that came into being only 12 years ago.IntroductionFSMA, enacted in 2011, is a landmark legislation that revolutionized food safety practices in the United States. Designed to address the challenges posed by an increasingly complex and global food supply chain, the FSMA introduced a comprehensive framework to prevent foodborne illnesses and ensure the safety of the nation’s food supply. This article examines the key provisions of the FSMA, its impact on the food industry, and the strides made in safeguarding public health through enhanced preventive measures and regulatory oversight.Overview of the FSMAThe FSMA shifted the focus of food safety in the USA from reactive measures to a proactive, preventive approach. It empowered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the authority to set stringent standards and regulations across the entire food supply chain, from farm to fork. The act encompasses several key components, including preventative controls, inspections, import safety, response to outbreaks, and enhanced partnerships.Preventive controlsOne of the cornerstones of the FSMA is the establishment of preventive controls to identify and address potential hazards before they can cause harm. This includes the implementation of Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (HARPC) by food facilities. HARPC mandates a systematic approach to evaluate and prevent biological, chemical, and physical hazards in food production, processing, and distribution. It requires food manufacturers to develop and implement comprehensive food safety plans, conduct regular risk assessments, and institute preventive measures.Inspections and complianceThe FSMA introduced a risk-based inspection strategy to ensure compliance with food safety standards. It provided the FDA with increased authority to conduct inspections, sampling, and testing of food facilities. The act also mandated the establishment of a third-party certification program, enabling accredited auditors to assess and certify compliance with the FSMA requirements. Non-compliant facilities can be subject to corrective actions, penalties, and even product recalls if necessary.Import safetyRecognizing the importance of imported foods in the American market, the FSMA strengthened the FDA’s oversight of imported food products. It mandated the development of a Foreign Supplier Verification Program (FSVP), which places responsibility on importers to verify that their foreign suppliers meet U.S. safety standards. The act also granted the FDA authority to refuse entry to imported goods from non-compliant facilities and increased the frequency of inspections for high-risk products.Outbreak response and partnershipsIn the event of a foodborne illness outbreak, the FSMA equipped the FDA with enhanced tools to respond swiftly and effectively. It established a food tracing system to track and trace products throughout the supply chain, enabling rapid identification of the source of contamination. Furthermore, the FSMA emphasized collaboration between federal, state, and local agencies, as well as industry stakeholders, to share information and resources and foster a culture of proactive food safety practices.Impact and challengesThe FSMA has had a profound impact on the food industry, leading to improved food safety practices and reduced foodborne illnesses. By shifting the focus towards prevention, the act has encouraged proactive measures, such as better recordkeeping, increased training, and improved sanitation practices. However, implementing the FSMA’s requirements posed challenges for smaller farms and food facilities due to resource constraints and compliance costs. To address these concerns, the FDA has provided educational resources, technical assistance, and flexibility in certain compliance deadlines.ConclusionThe Food Safety Modernization Act has transformed the landscape of food safety in the USA. By prioritizing prevention, enhancing regulatory oversight, and fostering collaboration, the FSMA has made significant strides in safeguarding public health and strengthening consumer confidence in the nation’s food supply.

Yeast,"bacteria, eukaryotic-microbiology, fermented-foods, fungi, yeast",Fermented foods of the world,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/fermented-foods-of-the-world/,"June 3, 2023","Fermented foods offer several potential health benefits due to their unique fermentation process, which involves the action of beneficial bacteria, yeasts, or moulds on the food.  In this first article, part one of three, we want to highlight some of the amazing fermented foods and beverages that have developed, often independently, through the world over the last few hundreds or indeed thousands of years.  In the second part of this three-part series, we’ll delve into the fascinating details of some the fermented vegetable products we list here before covering fermented dairy products in part three.  To start with though, here are some health benefits associated with consuming fermented foods:Improved Digestive Health: Fermented foods contain live beneficial bacteria, often referred to as probiotics, which can help support a healthy gut microbiome. Probiotics aid in digestion, enhance nutrient absorption, and promote a balanced intestinal environment.Enhanced Nutrient Absorption: Fermentation can increase the bioavailability and absorption of certain nutrients present in food. For example, fermentation of soybeans enhances the availability of nutrients like iron and calcium.Strengthened Immune System: The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in immune function, and consuming fermented foods can help support a healthy balance of gut bacteria. Probiotics in fermented foods may stimulate the immune system, potentially reducing the risk of certain infections and allergies.Increased Nutritional Value: Fermentation can enhance the nutritional profile of foods. It can increase the levels of certain vitamins, such as B vitamins, and produce beneficial compounds like antioxidants and short-chain fatty acids, which have been associated with various health benefits.Digestive Enzyme Production: Fermented foods often contain enzymes that aid in digestion. These enzymes can help break down complex carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, potentially easing the burden on the digestive system and promoting better digestion.Reduced Lactose Intolerance Symptoms: Fermentation of dairy products, such as yogurt or kefir, breaks down lactose, the sugar found in milk. This process can make fermented dairy products easier to digest for individuals with lactose intolerance.Potential Weight Management Support: Some research suggests that the consumption of certain fermented foods may be associated with weight management and a reduced risk of obesity. However, more studies are needed to establish a definitive link.It’s important to note that individual responses to fermented foods may vary, and not all fermented foods provide the same health benefits. The specific strains and quantities of beneficial bacteria present in different fermented foods can differ, influencing their potential health effects.

Yeast,"bacteria, food-quality, yeast",Spoilage of high acid fruit-based beverages,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/spoilage-of-high-acid-fruit-based-beverages/,"April 10, 2023","Introduction to food spoilage bacteria and their role in food deteriorationFood spoilage bacteria are microorganisms that cause undesirable changes in food, resulting in a decline in quality, texture, flavor, and color. These bacteria are ubiquitous, meaning they are present everywhere in the environment. They can enter the food chain through raw materials, processing, handling, and storage. When food spoilage bacteria grow and multiply in food, they produce various enzymes, acids, and other metabolites that lead to spoilage.Understanding the different types of food spoilage bacteriaThere are many types of food spoilage bacteria, but the ones that are most commonly associated with juice spoilage are thermophilic, thermoduric, and spore-forming bacteria.Thermophilic bacteria thrive in high-temperature environments and can survive pasteurisation. They cause spoilage in heat-processed beverages such as juice by producing heat-resistant enzymes that break down the carbohydrates and proteins present in the juice.Thermoduric bacteria can survive pasteurisation but do not grow at high temperatures. They can enter the processing plant through raw materials, equipment, and personnel. They cause spoilage by producing off-flavors and odors in the juice.Spore-forming bacteria are heat-resistant and can survive high-temperature processing. They can form dormant spores that can resist heat, drying, and other adverse conditions. When the conditions become favorable, the spores germinate and grow, causing spoilage in the juice.The impact of food spoilage bacteria on juice productsFood spoilage bacteria can cause various types of spoilage in juice products, such as:Cloudiness caused by bacterial growth and sedimentationOff-flavors and odors caused by the breakdown of organic compoundsGas production caused by bacterial fermentationColor changes caused by the breakdown of pigmentsThese changes can lead to a decline in quality, texture, and flavor of the juice, making it unsuitable for consumption.Factors that influence the growth and development of food spoilage bacteria in juiceSeveral factors can affect the growth and development of food spoilage bacteria in juice products, such as:pH: Most spoilage bacteria prefer a slightly acidic pH range, between 4.5 and 7.0.Water Activity: The availability of water in the juice can affect the growth of spoilage bacteria. The higher the water activity, the more favorable the conditions for bacterial growth.Nutrients: The presence of nutrients such as sugars, amino acids, and vitamins can support bacterial growth.Oxygen: The presence or absence of oxygen can influence the type of bacteria that grow in the juice.Temperature: The temperature at which the juice is stored can affect the growth rate of bacteria.The role of thermophilic and thermoduric bacteria in juice spoilageThermophilic and thermoduric bacteria are the most common types of spoilage bacteria in heat-processed beverages such as juice. They can survive pasteurization and grow at high temperatures, causing spoilage in the juice.Thermophilic bacteria such asBacillus,Geobacillus, andAlicyclobacillusare known for producing heat-resistant enzymes that can break down the carbohydrates and proteins present in the juice. They can cause cloudiness, off-flavors, and odors in the juice.Thermoduric bacteria such asBacillus,PseudomonasandMicrococcuscan survive pasteurisation but do not grow at high temperatures. They can cause off-flavors and odors in the juice, making it unsuitable for consumption.The role of spore-forming bacteria in juice spoilageSpore-forming bacteria such as Bacillus, Clostridium, and Sporolactobacillus are heat-resistant and can survive high-temperature processing. They can form dormant spores that can resist heat, drying, and other adverse conditions. When the conditions become favorable, the spores germinate and grow, causing spoilage in the juice.The impact of heat processing on the growth of spoilage bacteria in juiceHeat processing can kill most bacteria present in the juice. However, it cannot eliminate spores or thermophilic bacteria that can survive pasteurization. The presence of these bacteria in the juice can result in spoilage.A closer look at the most common spoilage bacteria in heat-processed beverages –Bacillus,AlicyclobacillusandGeobacillusBacillus,AlicyclobacillusandGeobacillusare the most common types of spoilage bacteria found in heat-processed beverages such as juice.Bacillus– spore-forming bacteria that can survive high-temperature processing.

Yeast,"bacteria, yeast",From microbes to meals: Understanding the benefits and challenges of single cell protein for a sustainable future,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/from-microbes-to-meals-understanding-the-benefits-and-challenges-of-single-cell-protein-for-a-sustainable-future/,"April 5, 2023","Single cell protein (SCP) is a term used to describe protein derived from single-celled organisms. SCP is a valuable source of protein for humans and animals alike, and it has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to traditional protein sources like meat and soy. This article will explore the meaning of SCP, the types of SCP, and the benefits and challenges of SCP in the context of a sustainable future.SCP definition and meaningSCP is protein that is derived from single-celled microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and algae. These microorganisms are grown in controlled environments and their protein is harvested for use as food or feed. SCP has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to traditional protein sources like meat and soy because it is produced using fewer resources and has a smaller environmental impact.Types of SCP and their benefitsThere are several types of SCP, each with its own unique benefits. Bacterial SCP is derived from bacteria and is rich in essential amino acids. Fungal SCP is derived from fungi and is high in protein and fibre. Algal SCP is derived from algae and is rich in vitamins and minerals. Each type of SCP has its own unique benefits and can be used in a variety of applications.Understanding cell protein production and single-celled microorganismsSCP is produced through the mass culture of single-celled microorganisms. This process involves growing the microorganisms in large quantities and then harvesting their protein. The microorganisms are typically grown in bioreactors, which are large tanks that are designed to provide optimal growth conditions for the microorganisms. Once the microorganisms have reached maturity, they are harvested and processed to extract their protein.The role of industrial microbiologists in SCP productionIndustrial microbiologists play a critical role in SCP production. These professionals are responsible for designing and optimizing the bioreactors used to grow the microorganisms. They also develop and implement strategies to maximize protein yield and quality. Industrial microbiologists are also responsible for ensuring that the SCP produced is safe for human and animal consumption.Fermentation as a method for SCP mass cultureFermentation is a common method used for SCP mass culture. This process involves the controlled growth of microorganisms in a nutrient-rich environment. The microorganisms are typically grown in bioreactors that are designed to optimize growth conditions. Fermentation is a cost-effective and scalable method for SCP production, making it an attractive option for large-scale production.SCP as a sustainable food sourceSCP is a sustainable food source because it can be produced using fewer resources than traditional protein sources like meat and soy. SCP production requires less land, water, and energy than traditional protein sources, making it a more environmentally friendly option. SCP can also be produced using waste materials like agricultural byproducts, further reducing its environmental impact.Nutritional benefits of SCP foodSCP is a high-quality source of protein that is rich in essential amino acids. It is also low in fat and carbohydrates, making it a healthy option for those looking to reduce their calorie intake. SCP is also a good source of vitamins and minerals, including iron, calcium, and vitamin B12.Challenges and limitations of SCP production and consumptionDespite its many benefits, there are challenges and limitations associated with SCP production and consumption. One of the biggest challenges is the high cost of SCP production, which is currently more expensive than traditional protein sources. SCP also has a strong flavor that can be unappealing to some consumers. There are also concerns about the safety of SCP, particularly in terms of potential contaminants and allergens.SCP in the context of a sustainable futureSCP has the potential to play a significant role in a sustainable future. As the global population continues to grow, the demand for protein will increase, putting a strain on traditional protein sources like meat and soy. SCP offers a sustainable alternative that can be produced using fewer resources and has a smaller environmental impact.Conclusion and future prospects for SCPSCP is a promising protein source that has the potential to play a significant role in a sustainable future. While there are challenges and limitations associated with SCP production and consumption, ongoing research and development are likely to address these issues in the coming years. As demand for protein continues to grow, SCP offers a sustainable alternative that can help to reduce the environmental impact of protein production and consumption.  As consumers, we have the power to drive demand for sustainable protein sources like SCP. By choosing products made with SCP, we can help to reduce our impact on the environment and promote a more sustainable future.","climate change, environmental sustainability, food microbiologist, food microbiology, food science, industrial microbiology, microbiology, protein, scp, single cell protein"
Yeast,"eukaryotic-microbiology, food-quality, fungi, yeast",Fungal contamination of food and how to control it,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/fungal-contamination-of-food-and-how-to-control-it/,"April 26, 2022","This is the final article in our series of fungal spoilage of food products, originally written by Doreen Ting from RMIT University in 2008.  As her project facilitator, I have made some changes to her piece below, but it is largely as per her original submission.Source of Spoilage YeastFood may be susceptible to spoilage with fungal contamination from a variety of sources. This may be from the environment (for example soil, air, and water) or from poor manufacturing process while intrinsic characteristics of the food (such as pH, water activity, and sugar concentration) can increase the likelihood of growth of these fungal contaminants (Ray, 2004; Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). The most commonly food spoiled by yeast, as mentioned earlier are fruits. Fruits, as received at processing plants, are often contaminated with large amounts of yeasts. In some cases, fruits that have been damaged before reaching processing plants, due to poor handling or damaged by birds or insects may contain significantly higher yeast populations (Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). Due to the exposed tissues of these damaged fruits, yeasts are introduced, thus enabling them to use the naturally occurring sugar and nutrients in the fruit to support their growth.Physiological characteristic of the food itself may also encourage the growth of yeast thus leading to spoilage. This may be due to several reasons, which includes: (i) pH value of food; (ii) water activity; and (iii) sugar concentration. Favourable growth conditions for yeast are in foods with low pH values (Martorell et al., 2006; Praphailong & Fleet, 1997;). As mentioned earlier, several species of the yeast genusZygosaccharomyces, were reported growing at a water activity level down to 0.62 (Frazier & Westhoff, 2005; Martorell et al., 2004) and some at a pH value as low as 2.5 (Steels et al., 1999). It is reported that food with a high concentration of sugars are also particularly at risk besides food with low pH (Tilbury 1980, cited in Steels et al. 1999; Thomas & Davenport, 1985; Tournas & Katsoudas; 2005).  As stated by Tournas & Katsoudas (2005), fruits in general contain high concentration of sugar favourable to yeast, which was mentioned earlier (i.e. glucose and fructose), the ideal water activity level with their low pH level thus making them particularly susceptible to spoilage by yeast.Poor manufacturing process may also contribute to spoilage of foods. Processing of food in a non-hygienic environment may lead to contamination of the food and thus leading to spoilage. Food produced in a non-hygienic environment introduces hazards, which can adversely affect the stability of the food product (Vasconcellos, 2004). Introduction of food spoilers at the very start of production increases the risk of food spoilage. Although most spoilers may be killed during processing especially during heat treatment, some yeast strains have the ability to survive in heat-stressed environment (Raso et al., 1998; Tran & Farid, 2004).As stated previously, the low pH of many fruits is the major factor that places them at risk of spoilage by yeast. Despite having most yeasts removed during early stages of processing (i.e. washing and peeling), recontamination can subsequently occur wherever there is opportunity for yeast to growth in later processing stages (Worobo & Splittstoesser, 2005). The use of contaminated equipments for processing (i.e. conveyor belts, slicers, fillers) are potential sources of contamination. Research conducted by Martorell et al. (2007) on yeast strains isolated from a high sugar environment (i.e. candied fruits and nougats) demonstrated resistance to preservatives however, did not show exceptional resistance to biocides such as peracetic acid and hypochlorite. The authors indicated that yeast spoilers might best be prevented through the use of biocidal agents in the factory rather than treating the food with preservatives. Food manufacturers are required to comply with the Codex Alimentarius: Recommended International Code of Practice – General Principles of Food Hygiene (Codex Alimentarius, 2003). In Australia, food manufacturers are required to operate in accordance with the Food Standards Australia New Zealand, which aims to control food safety hazards during production, manufacture, and handling of food (FSANZ, 2008).According to Tapia and Welti-Chanes (2002), Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) systems are important tools used by the food industry for production of microbiologically safe food. Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) involves general principles of hygiene whereas the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system involves identification of possible hazards and preventative measures necessary for the control of hazards (Vasconcellos, 2004).Control/Prevention MethodsAccording to Loureiro (2000), the consequence of food spoilage is a severe economical loss to the food industry because of the large scale at which food products are made. Due to its detrimental effects to the food industry, food microbiologists have continued to research on various methods in terms of controlling the growth of yeasts. As stated by van der Vossen & Hofstra (1996), it is advantageous to know the identity of the spoilage organism present in the product before designing strategies to prevent spoilage. Amongst the method used for identification and characterisation of spoilage yeast are: (i) analysis of long-chain fatty acids (Loureiro, 2000), and (ii) DNA based identification technology including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Casey & Dobson, 2003; Rawsthorne & Phister, 2006; Renard et al., 2008; van der Vossen & Hofstra, 1996) (iii) monitoring of isoenzymes patterns (Duarte et al., 2004; Loureiro, 2000).As mentioned earlier in the review, several yeast species are able to survive in stressed environments, which include presence of weak-acid preservatives. One species in particular known for its exceptional ability to resist weak-acid preservatives isZygosaccharomyces bailii(Andrews et al., 1997; Steels et al., 1999; Thomas & Davenport, 1985). Inactivation of this particular species was found only in environments with high levels of preservatives (El Halouat et al., 1998). However, due to legal limitations, researchers opted for combination of hurdles to achieve this. Though the mechanism of this has not been thoroughly understood, researchers have continued to carry out experiments on a combination of hurdles in preventing the growth of yeast in food. Weak-acid preservatives used along with pH adjustments (Cole & Keenan, 1986; Nielsen & Arneborg, 2007; Quintas et al., 2004), use of heat with combination of high hydrostatic pressure and pulsed electric field (Raso et al., 1998), and use of different type and amount of carbon source (Levya et al., 1999; Merico et al., 2003) were amongst the methods used in controlling the growth of yeast.Nevertheless, there has been increasing demand for foods with reduced amounts of chemical additives and less physical damage (Palou et al., 1997), in other words minimally processed food. This has lead researchers to investigate the use of modified atmospheric packaging as another alternative in preserving food products from yeast contaminants. Lucas (2003) view modified atmospheric packaging as a technique of shelf-life extension, which involves a mixture of gases including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen. Restuccia et al., (2006) reported that modified atmospheric packaging in combination with hurdles (i.e. temperature), work synergistically in maintaining freshness, extending shelf life and ensuring the safety of food. El Halouat & Debevere (1996), who conducted a research on the influence of modified atmosphere and preservatives on the growth ofZygosaccharomyces rouxiiisolated from dried fruits, reported on the synergistic effects of inhibiting factors such as low water activity level, preservatives and carbon dioxide. El Halouat et al. (1998) also found that modified atmospheric packaging enhanced the inhibitory effects of weak-acid preservatives used in preventing growth of yeast.Links to prior articles in this series and to the reference list of literature cited in this and/or prior articles.Food spoilage, with special reference to fruit productsBlog article published on 21 April 2022.Significance of yeast in food spoilage and their membrane transport systemsBlog article published on 19 February 2022.Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeastsBlog article published on 13 February 2022.Overall importance and general characteristics of food spoilage yeastBlog article published on 5 January 2020.Food spoilage yeast reference list","food microbiology, food preservation, food science, food spoilage, microbiology, mycology"
Yeast,"eukaryotic-microbiology, fungi, yeast","Food spoilage, with special reference to fruit products",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/food-spoilage-with-special-reference-to-fruit-products/,"April 21, 2022","This blog article is the fourth with have published, that showcases the brilliant work of Doreen Ting from the School of Applied Sciences at RMIT University, in 2008.  I had the privilege of guiding her on the preparation of this substantial piece of work, from which this is extracted from.  In this article, we provide an introduction to bacteria and other types of food spoilage, then delve deeper into spoilage of fruit products.  Such products, due to their origin and intrinsic conditions, tend to be, by and large, spoiled by non-bacterial organisms, almost exclusively fungi, which can be either yeasts and/or moulds.  This article provides some insights into that aspect.Bacterial vs. Non-bacterial SpoilageBacteria are the largest group of microorganism present while yeast is a member of the fungi kingdom.  Besides spoilage caused by yeast, food may also be spoiled by several forms of bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria and spore-forming bacteria (Worobo & Splittstoesser, 2005). Amongst the bacteria listed, lactic acid bacteria and yeast possess similarities in terms of the role they play, both beneficial and detrimental, in the food industry. Lactic acid bacteria and yeast both act as fermentors and both are also associated with spoilage of food. According to Vermeulan et al., (2008), microbial spoilage of acidified sauces stored at ambient temperature are predominantly caused by lactic acid bacteria and yeast. Regardless, both are still very different organisms. Lactic acid bacteria are able to proliferate when exposed to a given substrate that specifically suits their nutritional requriements and under storage conditions with low gas permeability (Farag & Korashy, 2006). Yeast on the other hand, especially the genusZygosaccharomyces, grow and survive in the presence of high concentrations of sugar (Cole & Keenan, 1986; Ludovico et al., 2002; Steels et al., 1999) and under optimum conditions, which includes low pH values (Cole & Keenan, 1986; Vermeulane et al., 2006), and low water activity level (Steels et al., 1999). Nevertheless, Levya et al. (1999) reported that different species ofZygosaccharomycesfavour different types of sugar.Z. bailiiwas found to be fructophilic (Levya et al. 1999; Vermeulan et al., 2008), favouring fructose and therefore metabolising fructose more rapidly compared to glucose. The ability of yeast to thrive in high salt or sugar concentrations environment sets it apart from bacteria. Therefore, they are capable of spoiling certain foods, in which bacteria are not able to grow.Spoilage caused by bacteria may result in organoleptic changes such as souring, slime formation, off-odour, off-flavours, and gas production (Farag & Korashy, 2006). This is most often seen in spoilage of raw meat by lactic acid bacteria. Yeast causes undesirable properties in food by producing off-flavours (Rodrigues et al., 2001), hazing (Rodrigues et al., 2001), emulsion breakage (dressings) (Vermeulan et al., 2008), gas production (Vermeulan et al., 2008), and ethanol production (Vermeulan et al., 2008).ZygosaccharomycesspeciesThe yeast genusZygosaccharomycesis noted for its infamous relationship with food spoilage.  According to Steels et al. (1999), this particular genus includes some of the most osmotolerant organisms known, yeasts which are able to vastly resist concentrations of food preservatives. The osmotolerant species, comprising ofZygosaccharomyces bailii,Zygosaccharomyces rouxiiandZygosaccharomyces bisporusare not only known for their fermentative spoilage in food with high sugar concentration, low water activity, and low pH value but also known for their heat resistance profiles (Chen & Tseng, 1996, Makdesi & Beuchat, 1996). According to Raso et al. (1998),Z. bailiihas the ability to form ascospores, which are more resistant to physical and chemical agents than vegetative cells, thus are also more resistant to heat.Food ProductsFoods are considered habitats for microbial growth. Food products commonly spoiled by yeast range from fresh (raw) fruits to soft drinks. Fruit juices and soft drinks impose an adverse environment for most microorganisms. This is due to their low pH value and low nitrogen and oxygen contents (Deak & Beuchat, 1996). These beverages however have been found to be excellent substrates for growth of yeasts. Fruit juices in particular are found to be most susceptible to yeast spoilage (Keyser et al., 2007; Elez-Martinez et al., 2004; Tournas & Katsoudas, 2005). Tran & Farid (2004) stated in their research that yeast is one of the most common spoilers found in fruit juices (i.e. orange juice). Other high sugar foods such as honey, syrups, jams, jelly, and dried fruits are also susceptible to spoilage by yeast (Deak & Beuchat, 1996).Fruit productsAccording to Deak & Beuchat (1996), yeast form a part of the natural microflora of most fruits, which is usually found on the external surface of fruits. Fruits are high in nutrients and moisture content. Its low pH (3 to 5) sets them apart from vegetables in terms of susceptibility to spoilage by yeast.  In addition, fruits are high in soluble carbohydrates, increasing their desirability to yeast as compared to vegetables. Therefore, weak-acid preservatives are widely used in high-sugar, low pH products such as fruit juices in which spoilage are most often caused by yeast. Weak-acid preservatives commonly used in the food industry such as sorbic acid, benzoic acid, propionic acid, acetic acid, and sulphur dioxide (Martorell et al., 2006) has been found to be of little use in preserving food products from spoilage unless a significant level of preservative is added to the food (Martorell et al., 2006). However, a constraint faced in this case is the legal limitation on level of preservative addition.Despite its benefits in reducing risk of obtaining chronic diseases, fruits are still consumed less especially by the younger generation (Ness & Powles, 1997; Steinmetz & Potter, 1996). Studies have shown that not everyone is interested in consuming the recommended dietary intake of fruits (Betts et al., 2003; Padula et al., 2003). Therefore, for many decades, health professionals have collaborated with food manufacturers in developing food products, in hopes of helping people change their dietary habits. This has lead to creation of different food products consisting of fruits, such as fruit juices and fruit yoghurt. However, due to this fast-paced world we currently live in, consumer demands has also moved to a different level. Consumers now demand fruit products, which are convenient and ready-to-eat, however, still containing sufficient nutrients for the recommended dietary intake. Consumer demand has lead to the production of minimally processed fruits. According to Alzamora et al. (2000), minimally processed fruits are products that maintain their attributes and quality similar to those of fresh products, which include dried fruits. The purpose of minimally processed fruits according to Laurila & Ahvenainen (2002) is: (i) to keep produce fresh, without losing its nutritional quality and; (ii) to ensure a product shelf life is sufficient to make distribution feasible within a region of consumption.Dried FruitsDried fruits are one of the most notable minimally processed food products on the market. A high concentration of sugar, low water activity level and low pH value of dried fruits causes it to be one of the food products susceptible to yeast spoilage (El Halouat, 1996). With its high concentration of sugar and its low water activity level, dried fruits are particularly at risk of spoilage by the genusZygosaccharomyces. As sulphur dioxide is most commonly used in preservation of dried fruits (Florin et al., 1993), some species of the genusZygosaccharomyceshave been found to be resistant to this preservative (Martorell et al., 2005; Thomas & Davenport, 1985).Fruits are dried to reduce the water activity level to less than 25% (Worobo & Splittstoesser, 2005), as fruit product usually will not spoil when the water activity level is below 0.65 (Corry 1987, cited in Worobo & Splittstoesser 2005; Pitt & Hocking, 1985).  El Halouat & Debevere (1997) found thatZygosaccharomyces rouxiiwere among the dominant contaminants isolated from high moisture prunes and raisins. High moisture according to Worobo & Splittstoesser (2005) is having a water activity level of at least 35%.Links to prior articles in this series and to the reference list of literature cited in this and/or prior articles.Significance of yeast in food spoilage and their membrane transport systemsBlog article published on 19 February 2022.Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeastsBlog article published on 13 February 2022.Overall importance and general characteristics of food spoilage yeastBlog article published on 5 January 2020.Food spoilage yeast reference list","food microbiology, food preservation, Food quality, food science, food spoilage"
Yeast,yeast,Significance of yeast in food spoilage and their membrane transport systems.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/significance-of-yeast-in-food-spoilage-and-their-membrane-transport-systems/,"February 19, 2022","This is a (barely edited) extract of a lengthly literature review written by a 3rd-year food science and technology student, Doreen Ting, at RMIT University in 2008 – I (Dr Philip Button) was her project facilitator.  The overall literature review is excellent, and despite its age, at 14 years old now, it will still serve a purpose as a review of the fundamental elements of key food spoilage yeasts.  On 5 January 2020, we published a blog article as part 1 in this series, giving an overview of the significance of yeasts in this context.  On 13 February 2022 we published about the physiology and biochemistry of yeasts in the context of food spoilage.  We won’t label this and subsequent articles as parts, but shall provide links to them, and to a separate document which contains all the literature cited.  In this article, we cover of the overall significance of yeast in a food spoilage context, as well as providing insights into the specific physiological system of membrane transport.  To be successful on numerous fronts, microbial membrane transport systems are key, and here we provide an introduction to these.Significance of yeast in food spoilageYeast are known to be one of the major spoilers in the food industry. Apart from their outstanding role in processes such as leavening of bread and fermentation of wine, yeast has caused vast losses to the food industry. It is able to grow in a wide range of food; high (syrups) to low (beverages) viscosity food, high sugar to high salt content food, and solid food such as fruits.As mentioned earlier, the yeast genusZygosaccharomycesis most notable in the food industry for having three species that poses serious economic spoilage risks to food manufacturers. Some yeast are able to thrive in harsh environments including environments with high levels of preservatives. The three species areZygosaccharomyces bailii,Zygosaccharomyces rouxiiandZygosaccharomyces bisporus. These three species are therefore regarded as osmotolerant (El Halouat & Debevere, 1996).Among the three species,Z. bailiipossess the most distinct and diversified antimicrobial resistance characteristics. A major yeast contaminant spoiling foods and beverages such as mayonnaise, pickles, dried fruits (Verma & Joshi, 2000; Deak & Beuchat, 1996), fruit concentrates (Thomas & Davenport, 1985), soft drinks and wines (Thomas & Davenport, 1985),Z. bailiiis known for its exceptional tolerance to preservatives, high sugar, low acid and pasteurisation regimes (Thomas & Davenport, 1985).Yeast have created undesirable properties in food products including off flavours (Rodrigues et al., 2001), hazing (Rodrigues et al., 2001), emulsion breakage (Encyclopaedia of Food Microbiology 1999, p. 2362), and brown film development on surfaces of food products (Encyclopaedia of Food Microbiology 1999, p. 2362).Z. bailiiis known to metabolise much aggressively compared to the other two species,Z. rouxiiandZ. bisporus. This not only has caused spoilage of food but also has lead to explosion of canned and bottled foods and beverages on the shelf (Levya et al., 1998; Oda et al., 2006). In terms of Occupational Health & Safety, explosion of canned and bottled food products on the shelf are significant as there is a risk of injury (Grinbaum et al. 1994, cited in Steels et al. 1999), which may also cause the company to be exposed to contentious liability issues.Yeast membrane transportThe purpose of yeast membrane transporters can be divided into several aspects: (i) nutrient uptakes (sugar, amino acids, and vitamins) (Belle & Andre, 2001); (ii) importing and exporting of proteins or peptides (Andre, 2004); (iii) exporting of toxic compounds from the cell to prevent any deleterious reaction (Demidchik, Macpherson & Davies, 2004). According to Munn (2000),Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the baker’s yeast, has been widely used as the model organism for the study of many cellular processes, which includes the yeast membrane transport system.The ability of certain yeasts to grow in a low pH environment with the presence of weak-acid preservatives has inflicted heavy losses to the food and beverage industry. Macpherson et al. (2005) believes that understanding the mechanisms of this resistance is the key in developing more effective food and beverage preservation methods. El Halouat & Debevere (1996) stated in their findings that at low pH, an active transport system is induced to remove both hydrogen ions and preservative anions from the cell. Both the hydrogen ions and preservative anions in the product of the dissociation of weak-acid preservatives in the cell (Pampulha & Loureiro-Dias, 1989).Macpherson et al. (2005) conducted a research on the weak-acid preservative resistance of bothSaccharomyces cerevisiaeandZygosaccharomyces bailii. Their research aims to investigate the uptake of potassium cation (K+) by both strains on long-term exposure to benzoic acid. Macpherson et al. (2005) concluded in their findings that long-term exposure to benzoic acid leads to accumulation of potassium cation (K+) by bothSaccharomyces cerevisiaeandZygosaccharomyces bailii, which improved the growth of both strains in the presence of preservative. In the presence of weak-acid preservatives, the plasma membrane H+-ATPase pumps protons out of the cell, which contributes to the inhibition of weak-acid preservatives from toxicating cells.According to Pribylova et al. (2008), K+is required for many physiological functions whereas a high concentration of sodium cation (Na+)is toxic for most cells. A research on the plasma membrane of salt tolerant yeastZygosaccharomyces rouxiihas shown that in order to maintain an optimal cytoplasmic concentration of K+and a stable high intracellular ratio of K+/Na+, the yeast cells possess a transport system, which participate in both detoxication from excess sodium cations and the maintenance of potassium homeostasis and intracellular pH (Pribylova et al., 2008). As mentioned previously, K+assists in the growth of yeast cells by stabilising their intracellular pH despite the presence of weak-acid preservatives. This is also known as the Na+/H+-antiporter system (Pribylova et al., 2008). Watanabe et al. (1999) reported that the Na+/H+-antiporter system ofZygosaccharomyces rouxiihas enabled it to survive in environments with high salt concentration as the system extrudes Na+across the plasma membrane of the cell.Links to related articles and to the reference list of literature cited in this and/or related articles.Physiology and biochemistry of food spoilage yeastsBlog article published on 13 February 2022.Overall importance and general characteristics of food spoilage yeastBlog article published on 5 January 2020.Food spoilage yeast reference list","biology, cell biology, food microbiology, food preservation, Food quality, food science, food spoilage, Fungi, microbiology, mycology"
Yeast,"probiotics-and-gut-health, yeast",How we address scientific challenges today,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/how-we-address-scientific-challenges-today/,"May 17, 2021","Long gone are the days when microbiologists worked in isolation and produced single-author original research papers, perhaps with the help of a technical assistant or research assistant.  Not only are demands on researchers seemingly greater than they were 100+ years ago, but research today is vastly different from what it was.  Multidisciplinary teams and Interdisciplinary research is the norm, and were not just talking about a team of microbiologists with different interests and different specialties, no I’m talking of teams spanning diverse disciplines in science, and even non-science, sometimes geographically separated by thousands of kilometres and multiple timezones.  Take for example, a project team I was part of at RMIT University several years ago – despite being a food microbiologist, I held a position in the School of Business IT and Logistics, where I worked (in the one project!) with e-commerce and innovative retailing experts, information systems professionals and environmental scientists trained in life cycle analysis (Figure 1).Fig. 1How are we leveraging the diverse expertise across different disciplines’ cross industry and academic 9and private research organisations) and breaking geographical barriers along with cross-cultural differences to advance science, and indeed society.  Really, that is all part of modern day science, and why diverse networking is an essential element of modern research and development pursuits.Another example I want to offer is my postdoctoral work, carried out in the School of Applied Sciences at RMIT University.  While we were all food scientists, I was a food microbiologist working in the Food Chemistry research group on projects in the area of physical chemistry and materials science, with experts in the area of rheology and calorimetric properties of food ingredients.  What might be the connection you may say, between food microbiology and materials science?  In this day and age, almost any discipline has an overlap and influence with another discipline, when talking of applied science and applied research as opposed to basic and fundamental science – which still may diversely multidisciplinary.Let me explain one example of a food scientist working at the interface of microbiology, physical chemistry and materials science.  One’s microbiome is an essential microbial ecosystem unique to the individual that functions in maintaining balance, not only in relation to guy or digestive health, but in other body systems too, even mental health as we are not coming to understand.  As a result of a range of factors, such as antibiotic-based abuse of our microbiome, our body’s microbial ecosystem may get out of balance, resulting in health disruptions, such as the rise and dominance of a pathogenic microorganism, no longer kept in check by ‘friendly’ bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract.  The area of probiotics, gut health and fermented foods is ancient, but enjoying a resurgence in popularity as people seek increasing natural ways to restore and maintain their health.  A traditional approach to restoring the gut bacterial balance is through probiotics consumed in food products, traditionally dairy products.  However, many issues have been raised with survival and the maintenance of viability of probiotic microorganisms in the sometimes harsh conditions found in food products (low pH), manufacturing (high temperature) and gastrointestinal passage (low pH), where sometimes, few viable cells reach the location of the gastrointestinal tract where they need to exert their effects.  While in various situations, basic studies on the microbiology of stress responses have elucidated elements of how tolerance (or lack of) to such conditions occurs, there is still a need for improved viability and survival of the diverse probiotics available, under the widely variable conditions found in products, manufacturing along with storage/distribution.  One approach that has been used in the food industry for delivery of sensitive compounds in found is encapsulation of various types, traditionally microencapsulation, but now encapsulation (Figure 2) on a nano scale – nano encapsulation.  There are many approaches with regard to encapsulation material and how the capsules are prepared that promote improved probiotic survival under different conditions.  Culture preparation is another factor that may be important in the ultimate survival of those encapsulated cells.  For example, in some circumstances, freeze dried cultures can be added to microcapsules, and perform better, with regard to tolerance to extreme environmental conditions, such as those encountered in food, during processing and in gastrointestinal passage.  To ensure that the highest concentration of viable cells possible is applied to the capsule, a cryoprotectant is typically selected that will allow the highest viability following freeze drying.  Certainly, in some cases,  forSachharomyces boulardii, this information is not known and consequently, we are likely to be missing out on maximising the effect of microencapsulation.  Thus, basic studies on cryoprotectants to determine, for example, important physical properties like the glass transition temperature (Figure 3) may be critical in advancement of this area of food science and highlights the cross disciplinary approach that can address a range of real-world problems to advance science.  Therefore, diverse networking and collaboration is essential – why not contact someone new today and expand your professional network?Fig. 2Fig. 3","food microbiology, food science, food scientist, materials science, physical chemistry, probiotics, research"
Yeast,"bacteria, food-quality, fungi, yeast",Complexities of shelf-life extension,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/complexities-of-shelf-life-extension/,"January 18, 2021","Food spoilage and the subsequent waste is costly.  The convenience of a long shelf-life benefit all along the supply chain from farm to fork.  Therefore, it is understandable that many start-up food manufacturers undergoing initial, or advanced, prototype development wish to extend the shelf-life of their product, for obvious reasons – today’s post-manufacture supply chains can be long and complex, and expensive too, especially if a cold chain is required.  Thus, achieving a lengthy shelf-life at ambient temperature is many people’s dream!  This also holds true for established food manufacturers, particularly when seeking new, more distant markets (especially in climate locations where temperature control is unreliable) or attempting to become a better proposition for selling in a physical, ‘brick and mortar’ store, where retailers wish to display for as long as possible to avoid price reductions due to food passing its Best Before date, hence cutting into their profit margin.It is not uncommon to look at shelf-life extension or optimisation, largely in terms of the finished product.  What can we do to the food to have it last longer?  Process differently or include preservatives are the two most common thoughts that come to mind when people look at approaches to increase shelf-life, although more brand owners are considering reformulation as a way to lengthen shelf-life.  Ultimately, reformulation should achieve one of two outcomes; I) provide some kind of an antimicrobial substance or II) alter the intrinsic conditions of the food such that the microorganisms cannot grow or grow more slowly.  Natural antimicrobial substances, such as from the inclusion of botanical essential oils (Figure 1) or bacteriocins are examples of such antimicrobial substances that will exert a preservation effect.Figure 1: The four best antibacterial botanic essential oils.If we consider the intrinsic conditions, this is where are really getting back to basics, basic microbial physiology that is learn during introductory microbiology classes … meaning their are factors which govern microbial growth and if these factors cannot be met, the microbes cannot grow, it really is as simple as that.  Examples of such factors are pH and water activity (Figure 2) and in turn, there are various ways to achieve these.  Water activity for example, can be lowered through an increase in salts or sugars.  Really though, the best indicators as to the shelf-life of a food and what is able to spoil it is pH and water activity.  Temperature as an extrinsic factor (Figure 2) can then offer further shelf-life benefits.Figure 2: Some intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors that can influence shelf-life.Water activity is a concept that is sometimes misunderstood, yet plays an absolutely critical role in the shelf-life properties of a product.  So what is water activity?  Is it the same as moisture?  Why is it even important?  Let me delve into these a little – moisture is the water content overall, but within what is considered moisture, there is water bound to food molecules and the like and free water in the food product.  It is this free water, and this free water only, that is available for microbial growth – it is measure on a scale between 0 (minimum) and 1 (maximum) (Figure 3).  Therefore, the concepts of moisture (total water content) and water activity (amount of free water that is able to be used by microorganisms for their growth) are related but different.  While moisture may give an indication of water activity, you cannot be sure, thus it is water activity, which is the definitive measure as to how much water is available in a food product to support growth of microorganisms.Figure 3: Water activity scale.However, if one is really going to optimise shelf-life then a myriad of other factors come into play, right from farm to fork.  While HACCP is the way that food safety risks can be managed and minimised, Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) during primary production (Figure 4) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) during manufacture are key elements to ‘squeeze’ every possible amount of shelf-life out of a product.  As a result, shelf-life optimisation needs to be considered in context of the entire agrifood farm to fork supply chain.  There are not a lot of practices that many consider as impactful on shelf-life.  As examples, farm hygiene, manufacturing environment design and airflow are some which might be forgotten as what needs to be considered to optimise one’s product’s shelf-life.  Furthermore, practices of workers is key, as are Standard Operating Practices (SOPs), which may need to be reviewed and updated.Figure 4: Good Agricultural Practices (GAP)Thus, many, many factors come into play when looking extending or optimisation the shelf-life of a food product.  It isn’t as straight-forward as changing processing conditions or adding in some preservatives.  There’s no doubt that it is a complex process requiring painstaking consideration and analysis of primary production, your suppliers, transport, manufacturing environment, personnel, retail conditions and possible temperature and other abuse by consumers during domestic transport and storage.  Therefore, knowing that these factors could be influential isn’t enough to optimise or extend shelf-life, it is vital to know how these factors could come into play in decreasing the shelf-life of your specific product.","food microbiology, food preservation, food spoilage, shelf life"
Yeast,"bacteria, fermented-foods, probiotics-and-gut-health, yeast",Kombucha is not naturally probiotic.,https://foodmicrobiology.academy/kombucha-is-not-naturally-a-probiotic-product/,"November 13, 2020","This topic is in a pretty hot space, because both kombucha and probiotics are very much ‘in fashion’ and trending at the present time across the worldwide, as can be seen in the all-time Google Trends for this word which has showed a slow rise over the last seven years, peaking this year during the third week of January (Figure 1).  Leading the way in search interest on Google for “kombucha” are New Zealand, followed by Australia (Figure 2).  This shows how interest in kombucha is at an all-time high in 2020, especially in New Zealand and Australia, followed by Canada and the United States.  Google interest in “probiotics” has shown an increase ever since records began (Figure 3), with a peak at a similar time earlier this year (late January/early February).  Search interest from Australia (5th) and New Zealand (6th) still ranks highly, although the United States (2nd) and Canada (4th) rank higher, with Singapore at number three.  Perhaps surprising is Trinidad and Tobago at number one – small sample size perhaps?  In any case, kombucha and probiotics are of much interest, particularly from westernised nations of the world with advanced economies.Figure 1: Global Google Trends for “kombucha”.Figure 2: Top five countries searching for “kombucha” on Google Trends.Figure 3: Global Google Trends for “probiotic”.Figure 4: Top five countries for “probiotic” on Google Trends.This strong interest, resurgence is fascinating, given the age-old origins of both kombucha and provides, essentially stretching back millennia for kombucha in particular.  At this stage I want to introduce the distinction between probiotic foods and beverages and fermented foods and beverages.  While there is certainly overlap, in many instances, they are certainly not interchangeable terms.  Let us just consider that all foods/beverages could be categorised as:Fermented and probiotic – for example most yogurts and kimchi.Non-fermented and probiotic – for example some popcorn and some protein bars.Fermented and non-probiotic – for example natural kombucha and sourdough bread.Non-fermented and non-probiotic – for example peanut butter or ice cream.Kombucha is naturally, a fermented and non-probiotic beverage (tea) of ancient Chinese origin with consumption for “magical” properties being known from the Qin dynasty (around 220 BC) with subsequent historical consumption in China, Germany and Russia (Greenwaltet al., 2000).  However even today, despite mass consumption as a functional food for various postulated health benefits, no real evidence of any health benefits exists in the human contextin vivoalthough promising results have been seenin vitroand with animal models (Figure 5) (Moraleset al., 2020).Figure 5: Laboratory testing, animal models and human success to demonstrate health benefits of kombucha. Source: Morales et al. (2020).Kombucha is produced by what is referred to as a SCOBY, aSymbioticCultureOfBacteria andYeasts and is widely known in consumer circles as “tea fungus” (Figure).  Within this symbiotic community (Figures 6 and 7), bacterial diversity is limited to mostly species ofAcetobacterwhile a myriad of yeast species are likely to be present (Teohet al., 2004).  A detailed review by Moraleset al.(2020) has identified the following microorganism groups isolated from kombucha; 22 species of acetic acid bacteria from six genera, 3 species of lactic acid bacteria from two genera and 41 species of yeast from 21 genera –AcetobacterandGluconacetobacterare the bacterial genera with the most species isolated from kombucha whileHanseniasporaandZygosaccharomycesare the yeast genera with the most species isolated.Figure 6: An advanced fermentative state of kombucha (Source: Jayabalanet al., 2014).Figure 7: Microscopic view of SCOBY.  Source: Greenwaltet al.(2000).So, while kombucha is indeed a fermented beverage, it is not fermented with probiotic microorganisms – it is fermented with yeasts and acetic acid bacteria that do not have any demonstrated probiotic benefit.  Therefore, their only role is to turn tea into kombucha through their growth and metabolic activity, thus producing a variety of compounds in the process (Figure 8).  Thus, while you may in fact be consuming live culture in kombucha, these microorganisms that have been used to make kombucha will do little for your gut wellbeing.  From studies conducted on the microbial content of kombucha, there is admittedly some lactic acid bacteria present sometimes, however while they MAY be probiotic, they are most likely present at too low a concentration to confer any health benefit to to the host, which is of course a key element of the World Health Organisation (WHO) definition of probiotics.Figure 8: How acetic acid bacteria and yeast ferment tea into kombucha.  Source: Tranet al.(2020).Manufacturers have thus sought to capitalise on the probiotic image of kombucha through the addition of probiotics to the product, that have no role in actually making the product.  This is fine, but it’s worth knowing that such probiotics are an additive because as mentioned above, they do not function in the fermentation process.  Therefore, from this perspective, kombucha has little difference from any other probiotic food or drink to which probiotics are added, to make them probiotic products, of which there are diverse types on the market these days, such as popcorn (Figure 9).Figure 9: A probiotic popcorn product on sale in a Melbourne supermarket. Photo by @pdbuttonLast point, read the science, believe the science and remember to only trust credible sources so as not to be misled by erroneous information that is more easily found online (Figure 10).  While kombucha might be delicious, they are not naturally probiotic and need to be made probiotic through the addition of probiotics (therefore, read the label and see if it is probiotic or a fermented beverage only) and there is certainly no robust evidence that kombucha has any human health benefits, despite such claims below in the popular health media online.Figure 10: An erroneous “blanket” reference to the probiotic and other health properties for all kombucha products.ReferencesGreenwalt, C.

Therefore, there’s no doubt that microbiologists are particularly valuable at the moment.  Especially virologists and those microbiologists that have an understanding of infectious diseases, public health and/or epidemiology.  Plus, some knowledge of immunology can be helpful to for vaccine development as can pharmacology for drug development.  However, it’s really the microbiologists that are coming to the fore.  People talk about ‘saving the world’ and about the impact and importance of careers, but microbiologists really can save the world.  If you had any doubt about the importance of a career in microbiology, then just consider what is happening in the world now and what has happened since December.  …and we’re not just talking about personal and public health, but livelihoods and the global economy.  The economy has gone ‘pear-shaped’ because of a microbiological phenomenon, something that could be stopped by microbiologists, if they are, or were given the opportunity.  The power is in the hands of microbiologists and those with an intricate understanding of microbiology, to save the world, I have no doubt about that.  So, if you want a powerful career, an impactful career, a highly significant career, then consider microbiology!A FOOD MICROBIOLOGY CAREERHow about a career in food microbiology?  What might that look like and what might one be involved with?  Well even in food microbiology there are many varied areas to work in.  The three key areas are: i) food safety, ii) food spoilage/food quality and iii) fermented foods, probiotics and gut health.  Each of these has highly significant impacts on society and on the economy.  Let’s look at each of these in more detail.What is food safety?Food safety is all about ensuring the safety of the food supply.  This means monitoring, auditing, regulating and developing policy for the purposes of safeguarding raw materials and manufactured food over the entire agrifood supply chain from ‘farm to fork’ or ‘paddock to plate’ as the concept goes.  Food safety microbiologists closely associate with epidemiologists, public health professionals and infectious disease experts to combat prevention, tracking and limiting the spread of foodborne diseases of epidemic proportions.What is food spoilage and food quality?Spoilage and subsequent wastage of food results in substantial economic losses.  In countries with developing economies, such spoilage and waste of food is more likely to be fresh produce and thus postharvest and pre-manufacure losses.  In countries with advanced economies, the situation is quite different, with substantial spoilage and waste taking place at the consumer level.  Tight supply chains along with excellent mechanisms of food preservation mean that spoilage losses in such countries are at a minimum.What are fermented foods, probiotics and gut health?This area is closely linked with personal health and wellness.  There is a sustained food trend in the area of probiotics as functional foods, along with prebiotics and people realise the great benefits of how one’s gut health contributes to overall health and wellbeing.  Related to this are fermented foods, many of which are probiotic, and as such, are rich natural sources of ‘good’ bacteria.CAREER PROFILE OF A FOOD MICROBIOLOGISTWondering how a career in food microbiology might actually look like in reality?  Well, I had a Q & A session with Lucy Lam, a food safety auditor from Taipei, Taiwan.  Let’s find out what Lucy’s food microbiology career looks like…What qualification(s) do you hold and from where?Master of Science, with a major in food, nutrition and technology, from The Chinese University of Hong KongBachelor of Food Science, from The University of MelbourneYour present position and where?Auditor, Bureau Veritas Certification  (Taiwan)How would you describe your career ‘in a nutshell’?A passion for food safety and quality control along with being good at problem solving. 1. Interest in manufacturing in any field, especially the food industry 2. Looking forward to opportunities to be involved more in food product development.Describe what you do you do on a day-to-day basis?As an auditor, I follow back office schedules to visit clients and conduct on-site audit. Before and after the audit, preparation of the report document is needed.How do you gain most satisfaction in your food microbiology career?When I gained the most hands-on experience in food microbiology when I was working in the food industry between 2013 – 2018. As I was a laboratory supervisor and department assistant manager, I had to oversee the operation of the laboratory including lab supplies, SOPs, good laboratory practices and third party laboratory compliances.What can you forsee as big challenges in your particular area of food microbiology?Food microbiology testing can be regarded as a quality control gate for product release and assurance in food industry. Hence the testing lead time will be demanding and tends to be “quick and accurate”. It is believed that rapid test kits or rapid test methods will be upcoming trends in food microbiology testing.Some advice about a career in food microbiology?It is suggested people who wish to be a food microbiologist must have basic food knowledge, and willing to do a lot of research and study.So there you have it, whether it’s building the health of individuals through improving gut health, ensuring public health is maintained through a safe food supply or curbing the substantial economic losses through food spoilage and food waste, there are multiple ways to save the world as a food microbiologist!

Yeast,"eukaryotic-microbiology, food-quality, fungi, yeast","Yeasts and food spoilage: Part 1, Overall importance and general characteristics.",https://foodmicrobiology.academy/yeasts-and-food-spoilage-part-1-overall-importance-and-general-characteristics/,"January 5, 2020","By: Doreen Ting and Philip ButtonOriginally written by Ms Doreen Ting in 2008, with guidance from Dr Philip Button.  Current update and partial rewrite by Dr Philip Button.Food serves as a source of nutrition for humans and animals. However, it also serves as a substrate for the growth of microorganisms. The growth of microorganisms can be beneficial (for example, during production of fermented foods) as well as non-beneficial (growth in food leading to spoilage). Yeast (unicellular fungi) are undoubtedly the most important group of microorganisms exploited for commercial purposes, in particular bread making and the production of alcoholic beverages (Deak & Beuchat, 1996). To give an indication of the economic importance of wine to the Australian, data from Wine Australia (2019) show 63% of Australian wine is exported to a total value of $2.8 billion.  However, yeast has also been a major concern in the food industry in terms of their ability to alter the quality of food products, hence impacting shelf life. The undesirable growth of yeast in some food products causes significant economic losses to the food industry. Deak & Beuchat (1996) state that yeast in general, are capable of growing in a wide range of foods under very specific environmental conditions, and under such conditions, metabolic activities of yeast may result in extensive economic losses to the food industry.  Such conditions include 65-70% (w/w) sucrose, where the extremely low water activity results in very limited competition (Tokuoka, 1993).  Spoilage of food products by yeast is detectable through odour or taste, in addition to physical changes. Therefore, in hopes of finding the best control method for these spoilage yeasts, one approach is adopting a “hurdle technology” concept such as the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system, which will be detailed in a subsequent part in this series.Yeast are certainly of special interest to food microbiologists due to the significant economical losses they cause to the food and beverage industry.  This is especially so because they are able to grow in a wide range of food; high (syrups) to low (beverages) viscosity food, high sugar to high salt content food, and solid food such as fruits.  These yeasts are characterised by their ability to not only survive, but thrive in environments hostile to many other microorganisms (Makdesi & Beuchat, 1996).  While osmotolerance is generally recognised across this genus (El Halouat  & Debevere, 1996), Malfeito-Ferreira (2019) says thatZ. rouxiiis recognised for its high-level osmotolerance whileZ. bailiihas a reputation for resistance to multiple normally lethal conditions, such as low pH, high organic acid concentration, preservatives and it also possess high osmotolerance.  Its ability to tolerate stress conditions is of major concern to the food industry, and in fact Malfeito-Ferreira (2019) states that members of theZygosaccharomycesgenus are amongst the most “feared” spoilage organisms amongst manufacturers of high sugar and high acid products.Z. bailii(Figure 1) in particular, is recognised as “the most preservative-resistant organism known” (Stratford & Capell, 2003).  Not only that, but stress cross protection has been observed in this species where exposure to a given preservative confers resistance to other preservative agents (Stratfordet al., 2013).  Furthermore, the fructose fermentation preference (typically producing acid and gas) ofZ.bailiiis a less common characteristic that can be exploited in its isolation from spoiled foods (Smittle & Flowers, 1982). These are major yeast contaminants, spoiling foods and beverages such as pickles, dried fruits (Verma & Joshi, 2000; Deak & Beuchat, 1996), mayonnaise (Kurtzmanet al., 1971), fruit concentrates (Thomas & Davenport, 1985), soft drinks (Thomas & Davenport, 1985) and red wine (Malfeito-Ferreira, 2019).Figure 1:Zygosaccharomyces bailiiImage source: M. Stratford, C.J. Capell, inEncyclopedia of Food Sciences and Nutrition (Second Edition), 2003Yeast have created undesirable properties in food products including off flavours and haze (Rodrigues et al., 2001) along with excessive carbon dioxide production (Zuehlke, 2003).Z. bailiiis known to metabolise much aggressively compared to the other two species,Z. rouxiiandZ. bisporus. This not only has caused spoilage of food but also has lead to explosion of canned and bottled foods and beverages on the shelf (Levya et al., 1999; Oda et al., 2006).ReferencesDeak, T & Beuchat, LR (1996).
